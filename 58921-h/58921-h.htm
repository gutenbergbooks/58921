<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>Foreword</i></span></h2>
<p>One&rsquo;s task in discussing Landmarks of Charleston is
to describe the more outstanding from the beginning
of Charles Town to this present year. It is an agreeable
task, but it leaves undone some things one wishes he had
done.</p>
<p>An Incomparable Stroll will give the visitor information
of people and places of <i>Charles Town</i> under the Lords
Proprietors, <i>Charlestown</i> under the Royal Government, and
<i>Charleston</i> under the Republic.</p>
<p>The gardens which bring thousands of visitors to Charleston
each spring are reached by excellent highways. Middleton
Place and Magnolia-on-the-Ashley are on the Ashley
River Road; Cypress off the Coastal Highway, United States
52. These gardens are so different that they are not competitive,
and the visitor questing for beauty that baffles description
should see all three, and, time permitting, journey toward
Georgetown and enjoy the famous Belle Isle Gardens,
on Winyah Bay.</p>
<p>In this work the index has been compiled with great
care and should be consulted freely. Charleston&rsquo;s points
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
of interest are too scattered to be grouped on a single route.
Near Charleston are traces of fortifications used in the
Revolution and in the War for Southern Independence.
They are too numerous for individual enumeration. Books
have been written about them.</p>
<p>From the building of the Colonial Powder Magazine to
the building of the Cooper River Bridge, the third highest
vehicular bridge in the world, is a tremendous gap.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to say that the author has consulted many
authorities; his quotations suffice to reveal this.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Historic Charleston</i></span></h2>
<p>Why Charleston? Three European nations were claiming
this southern country&mdash;the Spaniards called it
Florida, the French Carolina and the English Southern Virginia.
The Spanish claim was through Ponce de Leon, 1512;
the French through Verazzano, a Florentine, 1524, and the
English, it is said, by virtue of a grant by the Pope of Rome,
and through John Cabot and his son, Sebastian, both of them
in the service of the English King Henry VII, 1497-98. To
Edward, Earl of Clarendon, and his associates Charles II of
England gave a charter in 1663&mdash;&ldquo;excited by a laudable and
pious zeal for the propagation of the Gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Proprietors planted colonists on the Albemarle and
the Cape Fear, North Carolina. Things did not go well and
many of these people subsequently found their way to old
Charles Town, which was established, not by English design,
but through circumstances. Robert Sandford, &ldquo;Secretary and
Chiefe Register for the Lords Proprietors of their County of
Clarendon,&rdquo; had explored this coast in the summer of 1666,
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
and would have seen the site of Charles Town, but his Indian
pilot confused his bearings &ldquo;until it was too late.&rdquo; Sandford
however, renamed the River Kiawah the Ashley in honor of
Ashley-Cooper, later the Earl of Shaftesbury, one of the
Proprietors.</p>
<p>Sandford, off Edisto, near Charles Town, was sought by
the Cassique, or Chief, of the Kiawah Indians and importuned
to plant an English colony near the Kiawah village
on the west bank of the Kiawah (Ashley) River. The Cassique,
Sandford related, was known to the Clarendon colonists.
Sandford agreed to investigate, but missed the entrance
and chose to lose no further time by putting back. The Sandford
report so impressed the Proprietors that they authorized
the planting of a colony, not at Charles Town, but at Port
Royal, to the south. Colonel William Sayle, soldier of fortune,
was commissioned Governor when Sir John Yeamans, already
Governor of the more northern colony, left the adventurers.
Three ships were in the enterprise, but one of these was
separated. The other two made land at present-day Bull&rsquo;s
Island in the spring of 1670. The Cassique of Kiawah was
there and Governor Sayle was importuned to abandon Port
Royal and bring his colonists to the Kiawah country.</p>
<p>Sayle, however, followed his instructions and proceeded to
Port Royal, arriving in mid-April of 1670. The Cassique of
Kiawah had told the colonists that the Indians were on the
warpath and his story was confirmed. Carteret, who was in
the &ldquo;friggott&rdquo; <i>Carolina</i>, flagship, says: &ldquo;Wee weighed from
Porte Royall and ran in between St. Hellena and Combohe
(Combahee).&rdquo; Here the first English election in Carolina
was held, five men &ldquo;to be of the Council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sloop which had come with the <i>Carolina</i> was &ldquo;despatched
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
to Keyawah to view that land soe much commended
by the Casseeka,&rdquo; and soon returned with &ldquo;a report that ye
land was much more fitt to plant than in St. Hellena which
begott a question.... The Governour adhearing for
Keyawah and most of us being of a temper to follow though
we know noe reason for it, imitating ye rule of ye inconsiderate
multitude, cryed out for Keyawah, yet some dissented
from it being sure to make a new voyage, but difident
of a better convenience, those that inclyned for Porte Royall
were looked upon strangely, so thus wee came to Keyawah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, it was the Cassique, or chief, of the Kiawahs, that was
responsible for the choice of the site of old Charles Town.
First the colonists named their settlement Albemarle Point,
but in the fall of 1670 they renamed it Charles Town, in
honor of their King, Charles II. Carolina they named for
him also, but the French had previously called it Carolina
for their King, Charles IX. However, there were no French
in Carolina when the English colonists arrived; the French
effort at colonization had ended in tragedy, a hundred years
before.</p>
<p>No sooner were the colonists established at Albemarle
Point (where the Seaboard Air Line Railroad touches the
west shore of the Ashley) than they looked with favor on
the peninsula between the Ashley and the Cooper (the
Indians called this river the Etiwan), as much the more desirable
for their town, and in 1680 the change was officially
in force. The new town was facilitated by the voluntary action
of Henry Hughes and of John Coming and &ldquo;Affera, his
Wife,&rdquo; in surrendering land for the new town. John Culpeper
was commissioned to plan it. &ldquo;The Town is regularly
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
laid out into large and capacious streets,&rdquo; said &ldquo;T.A., Gent.,&rdquo;
clerk aboard H.M.S. <i>Richmond</i>, &ldquo;in the year 1682.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Town on the peninsula prospered as a port and
as the capital of the plantations. To ships in its commodious
harbor came the things of the fields, the woods and the
streams. Constantly new people were arriving and the outpost
of civilization rapidly took on the appearance of European
manners and customs, notwithstanding the incongruity
of savages, red and black, and Indian traders in their bizarre
garb. It was <i>Charles Town</i> under the Proprietors, <i>Charlestown</i>
under the Royal Government, and <i>Charleston</i> since its
incorporation in 1783.</p>
<p>This Carolina metropolis has had part in Indian, Spanish
and French wars. It has had bold adventures with pirates.
It was conspicuous in the Revolution and in the War for
Southern Independence. It furnished men for the famous
Palmetto Regiment in the Mexican War. The War of 1812
little affected it. Its men served in the Spanish-American
War and the World War. It is said that from the tops of the
highest buildings come under the eye more historic places
than come under it from any other place in the United States,
explaining the slogan, <i>Charleston&mdash;America&rsquo;s Most Historic
City</i>. It is in order to remind that William Allen White, in
an address, said that &ldquo;Charleston is the most civilized town
in America,&rdquo; and that William Howard Taft, then President
of the United States, pronounced it, &ldquo;the most convenient
port to Panama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Charleston survive buildings that were erected during
the Proprietary Government, many buildings that were
erected during the Royal Government. Survive scars of wars
and storms and fires that raged in the long ago. Survive street
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
names that were bestowed when Charles Town was in its
swaddling clothes. It is a far cry from old Charles Town,
bounded on the south by Vanderhorst Creek (Water Street);
on the west by earthworks and a moat (Meeting Street); on
the north by earthworks (Cumberland Street), and on the
east by the Cooper River. King, Queen and Princess Streets
are reminiscent of the Royal R&eacute;gime. St. Philip&rsquo;s, St.
Michael&rsquo;s, St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Berkeley, and St. James, Goose
Creek, were of the Church of England, under the Bishop of
London, albeit the present St. Philip&rsquo;s was erected half a
century after the Revolution, replacing the Proprietary building
that was burned in 1835.</p>
<p>But this work is concerned, not with the history of Charleston,
but with Landmarks of Charleston, and in the pages
that follow are tales of prominent landmarks, places and
buildings that are storied. Eminent Carolinian names pass in
review. The greatness of the lustrous past is linked with the
more convenient present. The Charles Town that was and
the Charleston that is are brought before the reader. The
author&rsquo;s effort is to present the facts accurately.</p>
<p>Outstanding landmarks include Fort Sumter, Fort Moultrie,
the Old Exchange Building, the Powder Magazine, the
Rhett and Trott Houses for their antiquity, the Miles Brewton
House as enemy headquarters in the Revolution and the
War for Southern Independence.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>An Incomparable Stroll</i></span></h2>
<p>Would you, guest within the gates of Charleston, see
things reminiscent of <i>old</i> Charles Town rubbing elbows
with things of modern Charleston? Take this stroll, a little
more than a mile, and you will be abundantly compensated.</p>
<p>Begin at the Mosque of Omar Temple of the Mystic
Shrine, on the site of the Granville Bastion, southeastern
edge of Charles Town in 1680. Proceed, southward, along
East (or High) Battery, washed by the Cooper River. You
behold the harbor declared by Admiral Dickins capable of
accommodating the fleets of the world at one time. Seaward
you see gallant Fort Sumter. To its left, Sullivan&rsquo;s Island,
on which is Fort Moultrie of Revolutionary fame; to its
right, by the Quarantine Station, Charles Town&rsquo;s first fort,
Johnson, named for a Proprietary Governor. On the west
side are some of Charleston&rsquo;s most desirable residences. You
reach South Battery.</p>
<p>Here you see the monument to the brave Confederate defenders
of Fort Sumter, to face that famous fortress. Continue
on the promenade which has inspired extravagant
phrases. In the park you see the capstan from the battleship
<i>Maine</i>, blown up in Havana harbor in February, 1898;
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
monuments to the defenders of Fort Moultrie in 1776, and
to William Gilmore Simms, novelist, historian, editor. Across
the park, at the foot of Church Street, you see the home of
Colonel William Washington, Virginian, who achieved a
lustrous record as a Revolutionary officer in South Carolina;
across Church Street is the Villa Margharita, built as the
home of Andrew Simonds, banker. At the foot of Meeting
Street, you see a memorial fountain to the gallant Confederates
of the first submarine.</p>
<p>Stay on the promenade and enjoy the sight of stately
palmettos bordering a beautiful park in which majestic oaks
are many. At the foot of King Street, you come to the Fort
Sumter Hotel. This building includes the site of the landing
stage used by Queen Victoria&rsquo;s daughter, the Princess Louise,
in 1883; first member of the English royal family to visit
the capital of the former English colony and province. Go
north in King Street. At No. 27 is the celebrated Miles Brewton
House, used by the British as headquarters in the Revolution
and by the Union commanders in the War for Southern
Independence. Note the picturesque old coach house.</p>
<p>Turn east and proceed through Ladson Street. At the
northwest corner of Ladson and Meeting Streets is the home
of the last Royal Lieutenant Governor, William Bull, and
across Meeting Street (No. 34) the home of the last Royal
Governor, Lord William Campbell, who escaped through
Vanderhorst Creek (now Water Street) to H.M.S. <i>Tamar</i>,
carrying with him the Great Seal of the Province. Next to
the Bull House is the home of the late General James
Conner, distinguished Confederate officer, and eminent for
his work during Reconstruction. At Water Street you come
to a corner of old Charles Town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Continue north in Meeting Street. At No. 51 is the home
of Governor Robert Francis Withers Allston, some time a
convent of the Sisters of Mercy, now the home of Francis
J. Pelzer. At the southwest corner of Meeting and Tradd
Streets is the First (Scotch) Presbyterian Church, organized
in 1731, an offspring of the old White Meeting House. On
the northwest corner is the old Branford (also called Horry)
home, the portico over the street being less ancient. On the
east side (No. 72) is the hall of the South Carolina Society,
which also houses the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Society, founded in 1729;
in this building are tables and chairs used in the Secession
convention. On the west side is the post office park, including
the site of the old Charleston Club, and of the United States
courthouse that collapsed in the earthquake of August 31,
1886. On the southwest corner of Meeting and Broad Streets
is the United States post office, completed in 1896; this houses
the United States court. On the northwest corner is the
county Court House, on the site of the old State House,
burned in 1788. Behind the Court House is the Daniel Blake
double house, one of the first of its kind in the country.</p>
<p>On the southeast corner is St. Michael&rsquo;s Church, on the
site of the original English church, St. Philip&rsquo;s. In its yard
sleep illustrious Charlestonians, including James Louis Petigru,
the epitaph on whose grave is famous. On the northeast
corner is the City Hall, with its great municipal art
gallery, including John Trumbull&rsquo;s renowned portrait of
General George Washington. This was the building of the
United States Bank, on the site of the early market place.
Behind and beside the City Hall, Washington Park, in the
northwest corner of which is the country&rsquo;s first fireproof
building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Proceed east in Broad Street. No. 73 is the site of Lee&rsquo;s
Hotel, known also as the Mansion House, &ldquo;kept by a dignified
and distinguished looking mulatto, once the most fashionable
hotel in the city and probably the best kept and most
expensive,&rdquo; said William G. Whilden in his <i>Reminiscences</i>.
Across the street (No. 62) is the Confederate Home which
before the War for Southern Independence was the Carolina
Hotel, a noted caravansary. At the northwest corner of
Broad and Church Streets, is the Chamber of Commerce,
oldest in the country, organized in 1773; this was the old
South Carolina Bank building, later the home of the Charleston
Library Society, which moved into modern quarters,
elsewhere on this stroll. At the northeast corner is the
Citizens and Southern Bank, on the site of Shepheard&rsquo;s Tavern,
birthplace of Ancient Free Masonry in America, Solomon&rsquo;s
Lodge, No. 1, having been chartered by the Grand
Lodge of England in 1735, and birthplace also of the Ancient
and Accepted Scottish Rite of Free Masonry, 1801. A block
to the eastward, at the foot of Broad Street, is the Old Exchange,
as historic a building as there is in all America.</p>
<p>Northward on Church Street, at the southeast corner of
Church and Queen, the only Huguenot church in America!
Opposite, on the southwest corner, the restored Planters&rsquo;
Hotel (1803), including the reproduction of Charleston&rsquo;s
first regular theater (1735), the company of players coming
direct from England. North of Queen Street, on the west side,
the reputed Pirates&rsquo; houses. St. Philip&rsquo;s graveyard is divided
by Church Street, running through the foundations of the
building burned in 1835. The first St. Philip&rsquo;s was on the site
now occupied by St. Michael&rsquo;s and the present St. Philip&rsquo;s is
the third. In the graveyards sleep, Edward Rutledge, Signer
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>; William Rhett, captor
of the notorious pirate, Stede Bonnet, 1718; Christopher
Gadsden, Revolutionary patriot; John Caldwell Calhoun,
eminent statesman.</p>
<p>Proceed through the western yard. You are paralleling
the northern boundary of old Charles Town, a matter of
yards away. You are in the Gateway Walk of the Garden
Club. Midway of the yard, you are behind the first brick
house in Charles Town, that of Judge Nicholas Trott; it
was standing in 1719. Next to the Trott House is Charles
Town&rsquo;s oldest building, the Powder Magazine, 1703, owned
and used by the Colonial Dames of America. Into the yard of
the Circular Church, cradle of Presbyterianism in Carolina.
Illustrious dead are buried here. The newspaper building
to the south is on the site of the South Carolina Institute
Hall, in which the <i>Ordinance of Secession</i> was signed December
20, 1860, and in which, several months before, the
famous Democratic convention of 1860 was held. You come
to Meeting Street, the Circular Church as the White Meeting
House giving its name. Down Meeting Street, at the southwestern
corner of Queen, is the St. John Hotel, on the site
of the old St. Mary's Hotel, opened in 1801; General Robert
E. Lee and President Theodore Roosevelt were of the notables
who have been guests of this house.</p>
<p>At Meeting Street you are at the western edge of old
Charles Town. Cross the street and pass through the yard
of the Gibbes Memorial Art Gallery, a section of the old
Schenking Square. Thence into the yard, of the Charleston
Library Society, dating to 1748, among the oldest in the
land. You come now to King Street. Down the street on the
east side of the next block is the Quaker burial ground and
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
site of the meeting houses that were burned. Cross King
Street into the walk of the Unitarian Church, its building
used by the British during their occupation in the Revolution
for stables, and, to the north, the first Lutheran church, St.
John&rsquo;s. You come to Archdale Street, named for pious John
Archdale, Quaker, Proprietor and Governor. Go southward to
Queen Street, at the corner of Legare (it used to be Friend,
reminiscent of the early Quakers in the colony) is the convent
of Our Lady of Mercy, a community of consecrated
Sisters, now more than a hundred years old. Opposite the
convent, in Legare Street, is the Crafts public school, memorial
to William Crafts.</p>
<p>On the left, at the corner of Broad Street, is the Cathedral
of St. John the Baptist, on the site of the Cathedral of St.
Finbar and St. John, burned in 1861; here Bishop John M.
England built the first St. Finbar&rsquo;s on the site of the Vauxhall
gardens. Go east in Broad Street. No. 119 (south side)
is the residence of Irving Keith Heyward with one of Charleston&rsquo;s
finest formal gardens. Next door, to the east, is a
property once occupied by Edward Rutledge.</p>
<p>On the north side of Broad Street, No. 118, is the site of
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Society hall in which President James Monroe
and the Marquis de Lafayette were guests of the city, Monroe
in 1819 and Lafayette in 1825; in which the <i>Ordinance
of Secession</i> was adopted December 20, 1860. Next door,
No. 116, is the former house of John Rutledge, &ldquo;The
Dictator,&rdquo; later Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States; here President William Howard Taft was the
guest of Robert Goodwyn Rhett. No. 114, once the home
of Colonel Thomas Pinckney, is the residence of the Bishop
of Charleston, the Most Reverend Emmet Walsh. No. 112
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
is the Ralph Izard house; the coach house in the yard is one
of the most picturesque in Charleston. This neighborhood
was in Mr. Hollybush&rsquo;s farm, just outside of old Charles
Town. No. 100 Broad Street was at one time the residence of
James Louis Petigru.</p>
<p>You come again to the intersection of Broad and Meeting
Streets and remember that here in 1876 occurred violent Reconstruction
riots; that in the Revolution, years before, the
statue of William Pitt was in the center and that a British
shell struck off an arm. You who have followed me on this
incomparable walk have seen things of Charles Town,
Charlestown and Charleston. You have seen things reminiscent
of early English and early French. You have seen the
evolution of a British outpost in a savage land into what
William Allen White has called &ldquo;the most civilized town in
America.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>Landmarks of Charleston</i></span></h2>
<p>POWDER MAGAZINE, <i>23 Cumberland Street</i>: In the
early days of Charles Town this storehouse for ammunition
was built of brick covered with &ldquo;tabby.&rdquo; It is known to have
been in use in 1703. It continued as a storing place of gunpowder
years after the town limits had been pushed northward
of Cumberland Street. When the British were besieging
Charlestown in 1780, a shell exploded near the magazine
and attention was thus directed to its danger. It was abandoned
as a magazine. Nowadays this ancient building is the
property of the Charleston Society of the Colonial Dames of
America. In it are many interesting and valuable relics. How
this magazine escaped through the years is one of the
mysteries.</p>
<p class="tb">NICHOLAS TROTT&rsquo;S HOUSE, <i>25 Cumberland Street</i>:
Next door to the Powder Magazine is Charleston&rsquo;s first
brick house, standing in its old appearance until a few years
ago when it was done over for business offices. It was the
home of Nicholas Trott, one of the chief men of Charles
Town. It is a large two-story building, its back to St. Philip&rsquo;s
western graveyard. Trott, born in England in 1663, came to
Charles Town from the Bahamas about 1690. He was Attorney
General in 1698, Speaker of the Assembly in 1700,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Councillor in 1703 and the Chief Judge after that. With the
overthrow of the government of the Proprietors, Trott&rsquo;s star
waned. He revised and published <i>Laws of South Carolina</i>
(two volumes, 1736) and <i>Laws Relating to the Church and
the Clergy</i> (1721). He died in Charlestown in 1740. Dr.
Shecut says that the Trott House was standing in 1719. &ldquo;The
great ability and legal attainments of Chief Justice Trott,
who acted as Chief Justice in all for some fifteen or sixteen
years,&rdquo; Henry A. M. Smith wrote, drew all the business and
litigation to it; his became practically the only court in the
Province. The Proprietors sustained Trott when the people
complained &ldquo;and the response on the part of the people was
to overthrow the Proprietary Government,&rdquo; Judge Smith is
quoted.</p>
<p class="tb">WILLIAM RHETT&rsquo;S HOUSE, <i>58 Hasell Street</i>: Wade
Hampton, South Carolina hero of the Reconstruction period
after the War for Southern Independence, acclaimed as the
savior of his state, was born in the house wherein lived
William Rhett, captor of Stede Bonnet, notorious pirate,
and his fellows, who were hanged, in 1718. William Rhett
was a great man in the early Carolina and Wade Hampton
in the later. Rhett&rsquo;s large square house was in excellent
condition in 1722, says Joseph Johnson, M.D., in his <i>Traditions
of the Revolution</i>. It is in good condition in this
year, 1939. It is entered through a broad piazza on the west
side and contains four large rooms on each floor. Colonel
Rhett is remembered chiefly for his capture of the pirates,
but other marks in his record are lustrous. He commanded
the little fleet that in 1706 put down the harbor against a
hostile French fleet under Le Feboure: the Frenchman
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
weighed his anchors and went to sea without offering a
single shot. A few days later Rhett&rsquo;s flotilla, a short distance
up the coast, captured a French vessel; among his prisoners
was the chief land officer, Arbouset. Rhett was born in
London, September 4, 1666, and came to Charles Town in
November of 1694; he died here in June of 1722. On his
tomb in St. Philip&rsquo;s western graveyard, it is chiseled that &ldquo;he
was a person that on all occasions promoted the public good
of this colony and several times generously and successfully
ventured in defense of the same.... A kind husband, a
tender father, a faithful friend, a charitable neighbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">QUAKER GRAVEYARD, <i>138 King Street</i>: Graves
among the oldest in Carolina are in the yard of the old
Quaker Meeting House property. The first Quaker house
of worship was built on this site in 1694. John Archdale,
Quaker, Proprietor and Governor, came to Charles Town in
1695, and attended services with his fellow Friends. The
property is a parcel of the old Archdale Square, nowadays
bounded by King, Queen, Meeting and Broad Streets. It
was just outside the town in those early years. This building
was blown up in July, 1837, to stop a fire. The rebuilt
Meeting House was destroyed in the conflagration of 1861.
Quakers came to Charles Town while it was across the
Ashley River. A letter from Shaftesbury, dated June 9, 1675,
said: &ldquo;There come now in my dogger Jacob Waite and two
or three other familys of those who are called Quakers. These
are but the Harbingers of a greater number that intend to
follow. &rsquo;Tis theire purpose to take up a whole colony for
themselves and theire Friends here, they promised me to
build a Town of 30 Houses. I have writ to the Gov&rsquo;r and
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Council about them and directed them to set them out 12,000
acres.&rdquo; The Society of Friends owns this property, but there
is now no meeting house in Charleston. The name of Governor
Archdale is preserved in the street of that name, on
which are the Unitarian and St. John&rsquo;s Lutheran Churches.</p>
<p class="tb">THE GATEWAY WALK, <i>from Church to Archdale</i>:
No visitors to Charleston should forego the pleasure of using
the Gateway Walk of the Garden Club. A bronze plate on
a gate at the Charleston Library says:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Through hand-wrought gates alluring paths</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>Lead on to pleasant places,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Where ghosts of long-forgotten things</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>Have left elusive traces.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This verse speaks eloquently for it. East to west, the walk
is through St. Philip&rsquo;s graveyard, through the yard of the
Circular Congregational Church, thence across Meeting
Street, through the yard of the Gibbes Memorial Art Gallery,
through that of the Charleston Library Society, across King
Street, through the yards of the Unitarian and St. John&rsquo;s
Lutheran Churches. There are two graceful wrought-iron
gateways between the Gallery and the Library which formerly
had place at the home of William Aiken, King and Ann
Streets, used nowadays by the Southern Railway System for
offices. Mr. Aiken was president of the South Carolina Canal
and Railroad Company from 1828 to 1831. Aiken, near
Augusta, popular winter resort, was named in his honor.
The railroad company a hundred years ago built the world&rsquo;s
longest steam railroad. In the large yard behind the Gibbes
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Gallery is an attractive pool with growing water plants. To
describe the Gateway Walk at length would operate to rob
a visitor of the tranquil pleasure of moving through it
leisurely. In the yards of St. Philip&rsquo;s and the Circular Church
are graves of early citizens of Charles Town. It is enough to
say that the Garden Club has achieved a unique and worthwhile
project. Elsewhere in this book is found information
of the six properties traversed by the walk.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. ANDREWS HALL SITE, <i>118 Broad Street</i>: The
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Society of Charleston was organized by Scots
in 1729. It is Charleston&rsquo;s oldest benevolent society, active
and flourishing into this season. Its hall was built in 1814
and here the Marquis de Lafayette was entertained in March,
1825. The distinguished Frenchman was the guest of the
city and was showered with attentions. Here he met his
friend, Colonel Francis K. Huger, who some years before
had engaged in the frustrated scheme of aiding Lafayette
to escape from an Austrian prison. Here on Tuesday, March
15, 1825, he &ldquo;received the salutations of the reverend clergy,
the officers of the militia, judges and gentlemen of the Bar,
and many citizens, after which he visited Generals Charles
C. and Thomas Pinckney, Mrs. Shaw, the daughter of General
Greene, and Mrs. Washington, relict of the late General
William Washington.&rdquo; In this hall was passed the <i>Ordinance
of Secession</i> December 20, 1860 (it was signed in the Institute
Hall, however). It was among the many buildings razed
by the flames in 1861. The St. Andrew&rsquo;s Society is housed in
these seasons with the South Carolina Society, certain of the
chairs and tables used in the Secession convention being preserved.
In the years before the War for Southern Independence
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall was the scene of many brilliant
social entertainments, including balls of that eminent Charleston
order, the Saint Cecilia Society, which had its beginning
as a musical society, presenting concerts.</p>

<p class="tb">JOHN STUART&rsquo;S HOUSE, <i>104 Tradd Street</i>: John
Stuart, born in England in 1700, came through Charlestown
with General James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, in 1733.
Thirty years later he was appointed the British general agent
for Indian affairs in the South. Captured by the Cherokees,
he was saved by Attakullakulla (the Little Carpenter). With
the breaking of the Revolution he engaged to incite Cherokees,
Chickasaws and Creeks (Muscogees) to war against
the whites. The Indian outbreak was to coincide with Sir
Peter Parker&rsquo;s attack on Charlestown in the spring of 1776.
It was foiled by alert Kentucky settlers. His plot being exposed
Colonel Stuart fled to Florida, thence to England where
he died in 1779. His property was confiscated by the independent
government. To escape the British, it is related that
General Francis Marion leaped from a window. His coattails
caught and his liberty was in peril. (That&rsquo;s the story, but
the house from which Marion fled is at the northeast corner
of Legare and Tradd.) Certain of the interior of this house
has been reset up in Minneapolis which has broadcast its
pride in the accession.</p>
<p class="tb">SITE OF FORT JOHNSON, <i>James Island</i>: The first
fortification erected for the defense of old Charles Town
was at the northeast end of James Island, within the present-day
Quarantine reservation. It was devised to meet the
threatened invasion by the French under Le Feboure and was
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
named Fort Johnson in honor of the then Governor, Sir
Nathaniel Johnson. In 1759 a second fort of tabby (or tapia)
was built on the site and this was the Fort Johnson of the
Revolution&mdash;&ldquo;in plan triangular, with salients bastioned and
priestcapped, the gorge closed, the gate protected by an
earthwork, a defensible sea wall of tapia extended the fortification
to the west and southwest.&rdquo; In 1765 stamped paper
was transferred from a British sloop-of-war and stored in
Fort Johnson while in Charlestown excitement prevailed,
resulting in seizure of the stamped paper by three companies
of volunteers under Captains Marion, Pinckney and Elliott.
The British garrison was placed under guard and preparations
made to resist any attack from the sloop-of-war. At this time
was displayed the first form of the South Carolina State flag&mdash;a
blue field with three white crescents. The naval commander
agreed to carry the stamped paper from Charlestown
and the incident passed off without clash at arms. This was
ten years before the Battle of Concord. In 1775, the spirit of
liberty gaining strength, Fort Johnson was again seized by
order of the Council of Safety, as a precaution against the last
of the Royal Governors, Lord William Campbell, British
troops being expected. In November of this year (1775)
three shots were fired from Fort Johnson on the British
sloops-of-war <i>Tamar</i> and <i>Cherokee</i>, which were engaged in
blocking Hog Island Channel. June 28, 1776, Fort Johnson
was commanded by Colonel Christopher Gadsden, but had
no opportunity of engaging Sir Peter Parker&rsquo;s fleet, which
was repulsed by soldiers under Colonel William Moultrie at
Fort Sullivan, known afterward and now as Fort Moultrie,
on Sullivan&rsquo;s Island. In 1780 Sir Henry Clinton reported
Fort Johnson &ldquo;destroyed.&rdquo; In 1793 the third work at this
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
site was built, but in 1800 a tropical storm so damaged it
that it was abandoned, being restored in the War of 1812.
At the site of Fort Johnson the Confederate forces defending
Charleston located a mortar battery from which to bombard
Fort Sumter. It now became &ldquo;an extensive entrenched
camp of considerable strength and capacity.&rdquo; The Confederates
evacuated this fort February 17, 1865, and the works
were allowed to fall into decay. Latterly there has been an
earnest effort at restoration.</p>
<p class="tb">FORT MOULTRIE, <i>Sullivan&rsquo;s Island</i>: A glorious day in
the annals of South Carolina was the twenty-eighth of June,
1776. A partially built fort of palmetto logs repulsed the
proud British fleet under Sir Peter Parker. Above this rude
fort floated a South Carolina flag with a blue field in which
was one crescent and the word LIBERTY. It was this flag
that Sergeant Jasper rescued, his gallant deed commemorating
his name. The first government of any of the thirteen
American colonies was established at Charlestown, March,
1776, with John Rutledge as president, Henry Laurens as
vice-president and William Henry Drayton as chief justice.
Against Colonel William Moultrie&rsquo;s rude fort on that June
day in 1776 was pitted a trained fleet of eleven armed vessels
carrying 270 guns. Moultrie&rsquo;s garrison comprised 435 men.
While Moultrie was engaged with Sir Peter Parker, Colonel
William Thomson with 800 men and two cannons prevented
Sir Henry Clinton from landing his soldiery. In the Battle of
Fort Moultrie the defenders suffered only thirty-seven casualties
while the fleet suffered more than 200, and the loss of a
frigate. It was from Fort Moultrie that Major Robert Anderson
on the night of December 26, 1860, removed his Union
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
garrison into Fort Sumter. The Confederates used Fort Moultrie
against the invading Union forces until Fort Sumter was
abandoned by the South&rsquo;s defenders. Before Anderson left
Moultrie, he had spiked the guns and burned their carriages.
Fort Moultrie helped make Morris Island an unhappy place
for Union troops under General Gilmore. At the entrance to
the old fort is the grave of Osceola, chief of the Seminoles,
who was brought a captive after the war in Florida a hundred
years ago. In these years the fort gives name to a
reservation which is the headquarters of the Eighth Infantry,
a small detail of Coast Artillerymen being on duty with the
coast defense guns.</p>
<p class="tb">FORT SUMTER, <i>at the Entrance to the Harbor</i>: Facing
the open sea stands gallant Fort Sumter. No fortress in all
America awakens greater memories. It is a shining emblem
of Secession, enduring monument to the incomparable defense
of Charleston by the Confederates. The bravest of
the brave served within this shell-torn fortress, withstanding
the siege of Union land and sea forces. Sumter is not alone
a proud fortress, but a landmark invested with a wealth of
patriotic sentiment. It is stirring American drama. &ldquo;In the
annals of the Federal army and navy, there is no exploit
comparable to the defense of Charleston harbor. It would
not be easy to match it in the records of European warfare&rdquo;&mdash;the
Rev. John Johnson, D.D., quoted an English
historian. In skeleton, Fort Sumter&rsquo;s great story includes:
April 7, 1863, it had part in the repulse of the United States
armored squadron after a severe engagement. In August it
&ldquo;suffered its first great bombardment of sixteen days, ending
in the demolition and silencing of the fort, chiefly by land
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
batteries of Morris Island.&rdquo; Confederates effected immediate
repairs. While these were making, the defenders of Sumter
beat off a night attack by small boats. Then came the &ldquo;second
and third great bombardments, one of forty-one days, and
the other, and last, of sixty days and nights continuously,
both being borne without any thought of failure or surrender.&rdquo;
The quotations are from an article by Dr. Johnson
in <i>The News and Courier</i>. In all, the siege lasted until
Charleston was evacuated February 17-18, 1865, &ldquo;after 567
days of continuous military and naval operations.&rdquo; The
famous fortress of Sumter, named for the Revolutionary
hero, General Thomas Sumter, the &ldquo;Game Cock,&rdquo; was built
upon a shoal, the Secretary of War approving the plans in
December, 1828. It is about a mile southwest of Fort Moultrie,
Sullivan&rsquo;s Island, and the same distance northeast of
Fort Johnson, James Island. It was nearing completion when
on the night of December 26, 1860, Major Robert Anderson
removed the Union garrison of Fort Moultrie to it. On the
twelfth and thirteenth of April, 1861, it was bombarded by
the Confederates for about thirty hours, Major Anderson
surrendering. He evacuated the following day, embarking
his men for the north. The Confederates at once put the
fortress in order for defense. There had been no casualties
on either side. Lieutenant Colonel R. S. Ripley was the first
Confederate commander of Fort Sumter and Major Thomas
A. Huguenin the last, the Confederate occupation extending
from April 14, 1861, to February 17, 1865. Fort Sumter
nowadays is without a garrison. It is part of the defenses of
Charleston. A military caretaker lives within the battle-scarred
walls. Modern coast defense guns are mounted. As a
grim sentinel, Sumter still faces the open seas.</p>

<p class="tb">SITE OF FIRST THEATER, <i>43 Queen Street</i>: Plays were
performed in Charles Town in 1703, according to Sonneck.
However, the first regular theater was the Play House in
Dock (now Queen) Street. Here in the winter of 1735, a
company, &ldquo;direct from England,&rdquo; presented its repertory.
Members of Solomon&rsquo;s Lodge of the Ancient Free Masons,
the oldest Masonic lodge in the United States, attended, in
a body, the performance of &ldquo;The Recruiting Officer&rdquo; May 28,
1737. The Federal government has reproduced this theater;
it was reopened officially November 26, 1937.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. PHILIP&rsquo;S CHURCH, <i>144 Church Street</i>: St. Philip&rsquo;s
is the oldest Protestant Episcopal congregation south of Virginia.
The first edifice was built on the site now occupied by
St. Michael&rsquo;s (southeast corner of Meeting and Broad
Streets). The second and third were built at the present site.
The first St. Philip&rsquo;s was erected in 1681-82. It was of
wood, but little is known of it. Early maps designate it as
the English Church. The second St. Philip&rsquo;s was opened
for divine worship Easter Sunday, 1723. It faced the west
and its steeple was eighty feet high. John Wesley, founder
of Methodism, preached in this church two hundred years
ago. The first Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of South
Carolina was the Right Reverend Robert Smith, rector of
St. Philip&rsquo;s. This edifice was known far and wide for its great
beauty. It was burned February 15, 1835. The third St.
Philip&rsquo;s was used for service May 3, 1838. Its chimes, cast
into Confederate cannon, have never been replaced. During
twenty-two years an important mariners&rsquo; light glowed in the
steeple, the other light of this range having been on historic
Fort Sumter. The light above St. Philip&rsquo;s was discontinued
when the main channel was changed about twenty years ago.
St. Philip&rsquo;s is known as the Westminster of the South as so
many distinguished men of early years are in its graveyards,
including Edward Rutledge, Signer of the <i>Declaration of
Independence</i>; John C. Calhoun, often appraised South Carolina&rsquo;s
greatest statesman; William Rhett, captor of Stede
Bonnet and his associate pirates. During the War for Southern
Independence Calhoun&rsquo;s body was removed for safekeeping,
but it was later reinterred. The story of St. Philip&rsquo;s
is coeval with the story of Charleston on this peninsula. Its
communion plate is of uncommon interest and value, including
pieces presented by William Rhett and a paten of
unquestioned antiquity. The present edifice faces the east.
The curve in Church Street passes through the site of the
body of the edifice that was burned in 1835. President George
Washington attended services in the second St. Philip&rsquo;s May
8, 1791, and President James Monroe May 2, 1819. The
present St. Philip&rsquo;s is accounted one of the beautiful churches
of America.</p>

<p class="tb">CRADLE OF PRESBYTERIANISM, <i>138 Meeting Street</i>:
The congregation of the Circular Church dates to 1681. The
small wooden building in the erection of which Landgrave
Joseph Blake was influential was known as the White Meeting
House and was replaced in 1804 by a brick edifice circular
in form, that was burned in 1861. It was this church that gave
name to Meeting Street. From this congregation sprang two
other congregations, the First (Scotch) Presbyterian and the
Unitarian. Some of the earliest graves in Charles Town are
in the Circular Churchyard. David Ramsay, physician, statesman
and historian, is buried in it. Some of the early Huguenots
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
(French Protestants) are also buried in it. The chapel
in the rear of the yard was built after the fire of 1861. The
present edifice is without a great portico over the street.</p>
<p class="tb">HUGUENOT CHURCH, <i>136 Church Street</i>: The only
Huguenot Church in America! This is the proud and unique
distinction of the French Protestant Church in Charleston.
Its congregation holds to the old Huguenot litany. It dates
to 1681. The first recognized and regular pastor of the
French Church was the Reverend Elias Prioleau, who came
with the &ldquo;great Huguenot immigration&rdquo; about 1687; he
died in 1699. Alluding to the Huguenots of Charles Town
Bancroft said: &ldquo;Their Church was in Charles Town and
thither every Lord&rsquo;s Day, gathering from their plantations
upon the banks of the Cooper, and taking advantage of
the ebb and flow of the tide, they might all regularly be
seen, the parents with their children, whom no bigot could
now wrest from them, making their way in light skiffs
through scenes so tranquil, that silence was broken only by
the rippling of oars and the hum of the flourishing village
at the confluence of the rivers.&rdquo; The first Huguenot Church
was burned in 1740. The second church was also burned,
in 1797. It was at once rebuilt and in 1845 it was remodeled
to the form it now presents. &ldquo;The church edifice is of great
architectural beauty, being of pure Gothic, and its walls
are adorned with mural tablets, commemorating the names
and memories of the first Huguenot emigrants to Carolina.&rdquo;
It is the boast of this congregation that it has had a church
on the same site for more years than has any other Charleston
congregation. For more than one hundred and fifty years
the services were in the French language.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p class="tb">FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, <i>61 Church Street</i>: When
Charles Town on the peninsula was about three years old
the first congregation of Baptists was formed. Some of these
Baptists came from New England, with the Reverend
William Screven, their pastor, and others came from England.
Old records show that for several years the Baptists
worshipped in the home of Mrs. William Chapman. Lady
Blake, and her mother, Lady Axtell, were both Baptists
and members of this congregation; their official rank lent
strength to the church. William Elliott, a member, gave the
site of the First Baptist Church in 1699. A wooden building
was erected. The present building was on the site before
1826 and of it Mills says it showed &ldquo;the best specimen of
correct taste in architecture of the modern buildings in the
city.&rdquo; There are many old graves in its yard.</p>
<p class="tb">SCOTCH PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, <i>53 Meeting
Street</i>: Sprung from the White Meeting House, the First
(Scotch) Presbyterian Church dates to 1731. The Reverend
Hugh Stewart, a native Scot, was its first pastor. The
present edifice was dedicated in 1814. It was severely damaged
in the earthquake of August 31, 1886, but fully
restored. It has one of the finest auditoriums in the country.
When the Marquis of Lorne (later the Duke of Argyle)
and his wife, the Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria,
were in Charleston in January, 1883, they visited the
Scotch Church to inspect a memorial tablet to their cousin,
Lady Anne Murray. The Duke of Sutherland also made a
trip to Charleston expressly to see it. May 2, 1819, President
James Monroe attended service in the Scotch Church, hearing
a sermon by the Reverend Mr. Reid, the pastor. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
church celebrated its bicentennial in March, 1931. During
100 years it has had three pastors&mdash;the Reverend John Forrest,
D.D., forty-seven years, the Reverend W. Taliaferro
Thompson, D.D., twenty years and the Reverend Alexander
Sprunt, D.D., thirty-three years. Prominent Charlestonians
sleep the sleep eternal in its yard.</p>
<p class="tb">TRINITY METHODIST CHURCH, <i>273 Meeting Street</i>:
As its congregation springs from the old Cumberland Church,
the first Methodist group in Charleston (1786), Trinity
may be called Charleston&rsquo;s oldest Methodist congregation,
but the building it now occupies was recently acquired from
the Westminster Presbyterian Church (which combined the
abandoned Third Presbyterian in Archdale Street and the
Glebe Street Presbyterian Church). Through years Trinity
Church was at 57 Hasell Street. Here the first church was
erected before 1813. For a short time the church was used
by an Episcopal congregation. The story goes that some of
the congregation were not agreeable to occupancy by Episcopalians
and sought legal counsel. They were informed that
possession was &ldquo;nine points in the law.&rdquo; So, after an Episcopalian
service, the Methodist brothers and sisters, when the
congregation was dismissed, locked the doors from the inside,
fastened the windows and mounted guard within the edifice,
women assisting, until the case was returned in their favor.
During this peaceful siege, a lad was born in the building;
he years later became a bishop of the church. The Methodist
church was planted in Charleston when Bishop Asbury and
his associates came here in 1785. The first church building
was erected in Cumberland Street in 1787, and within it the
first Methodist Conference in South Carolina was held the
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
same year. This building was destroyed in the fire of 1861.
John and Charles Wesley had visited Charlestown in 1736.
John Wesley preached in St. Philip&rsquo;s Episcopal Church in
1737. The Wesleys came with General James Oglethorpe&rsquo;s
Georgia colonists. Charles Wesley was the general&rsquo;s secretary
and John Wesley was to be a missionary among the
Indians.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. JOHN&rsquo;S LUTHERAN CHURCH, <i>10 Archdale Street</i>:
The Lutheran congregation of St. John&rsquo;s was organized in
1757 with the Reverend John George Fredichs as pastor.
Lacking a building of their own the Lutherans used the
French Huguenot Church. June 24, 1764, the first St. John&rsquo;s
was dedicated. The present brick building was dedicated
January 18, 1818, the Reverend Dr. John Bachman, friend
and associate of J. J. Audubon, the celebrated naturalist, being
the pastor. This congregation was influential in the organization
of Newberry College and the Lutheran Theological
Seminary in South Carolina. Prominent persons of German
origin or descent are buried in the yard. But the Lutheran
story goes back to March, 1734. In his <i>Sketch of St. John&rsquo;s</i>,
the Reverend E. T. Horn says: &ldquo;In March, 1734, while the
ship containing the exiled Salzburgers lay off the harbor of
Charleston, Governor Oglethorpe brought their Commissary,
the Baron von Reck, and their pastor, the Reverend John
Martin Bolzius, with him to the city. Here they found a few
Germans, firm in their attachment to the Lutheran faith,
and hungering and thirsting for the Holy Supper. In May,
therefore, Bolzius was glad to accompany von Reck as far
as Charleston, that he might minister to this little company,
and on Sunday, May 26th, 1754, at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
most probably in the inn where Bolzius was stopping, he
administered the Holy Communion to those whom on the
day before he had examined and absolved according to the
usages of the Lutheran Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">UNITARIAN CHURCH, <i>6 Archdale Street</i>: Just before
the American Revolution, the Circular Church on Meeting
Street, cradle of Presbyterianism in Charles Town, found
it necessary to use an additional building. Thus another
church with another pastor was established in Archdale
Street. One of the pastors espoused Unitarianism and by
amicable agreement the part of the congregation following
his teachings took over the Archdale Street church. While
the British occupied Charlestown during the Revolution,
they stabled horses in this edifice. The present church building
was dedicated in April of 1854, and is much praised for
its architecture. The ceiling of the nave is peculiarly attractive.
The pastor of this Unitarian congregation, the only one
in Charleston, was the Reverend Samuel Gilman, author of
the famous college song, &ldquo;Fair Harvard,&rdquo; and in his memory
Harvard alumni arranged the Samuel Gilman Memorial
Room in the church tower; the ceremony was performed
April 16, 1916.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. MARY&rsquo;S CATHOLIC CHURCH, <i>79 Hasell Street</i>:
Mother parish of the Roman Catholic Church in North and
South Carolina and Georgia, St. Mary&rsquo;s congregation was
organized in 1794, and in 1798 bought a frame building
from a Protestant congregation. In 1836 this was burned
and on the site the present fine brick edifice was erected
being completed in 1838. In the late 1890&rsquo;s the interior was
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
improved. Memorial stained-glass windows were emplaced.
Of its interesting graveyard Bishop John M. England who
came to Charleston in 1820 (finding two Catholic churches
occupied and two priests doing duty) wrote: &ldquo;The cemetery
of this church which is now in the center of the city
affords in the inscriptions of its monuments the evidence of
the Catholicity of those whose ashes it contains. You may
find the American and the European side by side....
The family of the Count de Grasse, who commanded the
fleets of France near the Commodore of the United States
and his partner, sleep in the hope of being resuscitated by
the same trumpet.&rdquo; According to David Ramsay, &ldquo;prior to
the American Revolution in 1776, there were very few
Roman Catholics in Charleston, and these had no ministry,
but of all other countries none has furnished the Province
with so many inhabitants as Ireland.&rdquo; About 1786 a vessel
bound for South America, having an Italian priest aboard,
put into Charleston. This priest celebrated mass for a congregation
of about twelve persons. It was &ldquo;the first Mass
celebrated in Charleston and may be regarded as the introduction
of the Catholic religion to the States of North Carolina,
South Carolina and Georgia which afterward constituted
the See of Charleston.&rdquo; The history of St. Mary&rsquo;s is
coeval with the history of the Roman Catholic religion in
the Southeast, excluding the Florida possessions of the
Spanish.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. JAMES, GOOSE CREEK, <i>off the Coastal Highway</i>:
The British Royal Arms still stand in South Carolina! The
British yoke was thrown off one hundred and sixty years ago,
but in St. James Church, Goose Creek, sixteen miles from
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
the city hall of Charleston the Royal Arms have never come
down! The ancient edifice stands in a tranquil woodland,
quite near The Oaks, home of Arthur Middleton in early
years. At the foot of the altar is a tomb with this inscription:
&ldquo;Here lyeth the body of the Reverend Francis Le Jau, Doctor
in Divinity, of Trinity College, Dublin, who came to this
Province October, 1706, and was one of the first missionaries
sent by the honourable society to this Province,
and was the first Rector of St. James, Goose Creek, Obijt.
15th September, 1717, &aelig;tat 52, to whose memory this stone
is fixed by his only Son, Francis Le Jau.&rdquo; In the records left
by Dr. Le Jau is mentioned that he christened Indians. Four
acres for the old parsonage were the gift of Arthur Middleton,
and another pioneer gave the Glebe of one hundred
acres. The cherubs in stucco over each of the keystones are
famous and so is the pelican feeding her young, over the
west door. Interesting memorial tablets have places. In
the present day this picturesque and historic church is easily
reached by automobile. Each year at Easter divine services
are held in the church, the congregation invariably overflowing
the building. The original church was built soon after
Dr. Le Jau&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. ANDREW&rsquo;S, BERKELEY, <i>on the Ashley River Road</i>:
The parish of St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Berkeley (the district about
Charles Town was Berkeley in olden times), was founded
in 1706 and a simple brick building erected. Seventeen years
later this was enlarged, taking the form of a cross. The
gallery was intended for non-pewholders and was later set
aside for negroes. Destroyed by fire it was rebuilt in 1764
and is one of the few rural churches that has survived the
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
Revolution and the War for Southern Independence. St.
Andrew&rsquo;s was one of ten parishes authorized by act of the
Assembly in 1706 regulating religious worship in accordance
with the forms of the Church of England. In quite
recent years a question relative to the jurisdiction of the
Bishop of London was raised! St. Andrew&rsquo;s had its genesis
when the colony had a population of 9,000, &ldquo;of whom 5,000
were Negro and Indian slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">ASHLEY RIVER ROAD, <i>Leading to Famous Gardens</i>:
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church is but one of many interesting and
historic places on the Ashley River Road. Two miles from
the Ashley River Bridge the road passes near the site of the
original Charles Town in South Carolina and three miles
farther is the Ashley Hall plantation of the Bull family, distinguished
in provincial and colonial periods. It was on the
Bull place that Attakullakulla, a chief of the Cherokee Indians,
signed a treaty of peace in the 1760&rsquo;s after his tribe
had been severely humbled by the whites. Just across the
highway were the lovely Magwood Gardens, now the property
of a granddaughter of President Abraham Lincoln. Here
the highway passes through a grove of majestic live oaks
festooned with Spanish moss. Seven miles from the bridge
one passes St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church and a short distance farther
through old Fort Bull, the moat about which has been filled.
Next, on the right, is the entrance to Drayton Hall, then
Magnolia Gardens, Runnymede, home of John Julius Pringle,
Speaker of the House of the Assembly in 1787, and later the
property of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, of the famous
Pinckney family; Middleton Place (gardens) where is buried
Arthur Middleton, Signer of the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>;
the seat of the old Wragg barony; the Ashley River
is crossed at Bacon&rsquo;s Bridge near which stands an ancient
oak beneath the spreading boughs of which General Francis
Marion is alleged to have entertained a British officer (it is a
pretty legend, but its site is severally located). Half a mile
beyond the bridge is the road leading down to the ruins of old
Dorchester, established in 1696 by colonists from Dorchester,
Massachusetts, led by the Reverend Joseph Lord. In this year
ruins of fort and churches are mute reminders of a brave village
in a primeval wilderness infested with savage Indians.
From Bacon&rsquo;s Bridge the distance to Summerville is five
miles. It is a drive every visitor to this section should follow.
In the season, the Middleton Place and Magnolia Gardens
are open to visitors.</p>

<p class="tb">CASTLE PINCKNEY, <i>in Charleston Harbor</i>: Stand on
the incomparable Battery and look seaward. Fort Sumter
is in plain view, of course, but nearer the gaze is Castle
Pinckney, holding the status nowadays of a government
monument. It is to be reached only by boat. The fort at the
edge of the sand bank known as Shute&rsquo;s Folly was built after
the Revolution, in 1797-1804. Later, it was enlarged. In the
War for Southern Independence, it lacked opportunity to
contribute materially to the defense of Charleston. Really
there is more legend than history about Castle Pinckney, but
long it has been a well-known landmark. The government
used it as a depot for aids for navigation until the depot was
established at the foot of Tradd Street, on the Ashley River,
site of the old Chisolm&rsquo;s rice mill. An excuse for including
it among <i>Landmarks of Charleston</i> is that many strangers
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
promenading on the High Battery wish to know what Castle
Pinckney is.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. MICHAEL&rsquo;S CHURCH, <i>78 Meeting Street</i>: Five
times have the bells of St. Michael&rsquo;s crossed the Atlantic
ocean. They came from England in 1764 and returned there
after the British evacuated the town in 1784. Repurchased
for Charleston, they came back to their steeple. During the
War for Southern Independence they were taken for safekeeping
to Columbia and in the burning of that town charged
to General William Tecumseh Sherman (who had been a
social favorite in Charleston before the war) they were so
damaged that they were shipped to England. There they
were recast in the original molds. Brought back they are still
in the steeple, pealing on occasions. When Charles Town on
the peninsula was laid out, a lot was designed for the English
church, St. Philip&rsquo;s. A wooden building was erected. This
being outgrown a brick church was built on Church Street,
on the present site of St. Philip&rsquo;s. By act of the Assembly,
June, 1751, Charlestown was divided into two parishes; the
lower, St. Michael&rsquo;s, and the upper, St. Philip&rsquo;s. February 17,
1752, the corner stone was laid with much ceremony, the
<i>South Carolina Gazette</i> carrying an account. The reputed
successor of Sir Christopher Wrenn was the architect and the
edifice is declared to resemble St. Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Field, London,
near Trafalgar Square. From the pavement to the ball
of the steeple is 182 feet. During the War for Southern Independence,
the steeple, and that of St. Philip&rsquo;s, offered shining
marks for the Union artillerists. Cannon balls struck the
church, but not with serious results. Heavy damage was done
by the earthquake of August 31, 1886. The old clock in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
steeple, with four dials, began the keeping of Charlestown
time in 1764. President George Washington and the Marquis
de Lafayette have worshipped in St. Michael&rsquo;s. In the taxed
tea excitement of 1774, the assistant rector of St. Michael&rsquo;s
preached a sermon that aroused his congregation and he received
his walking papers. In the yard of this church are illustrious
dead, including James Louis Petigru, eminent South
Carolina lawyer, an opponent of Nullification in the 1830&rsquo;s
and of Secession in 1860; however, when his state had seceded,
Mr. Petigru cast his fortune with the Confederacy. The
incumbent Bishop of South Carolina, the Right Reverend
Albert S. Thomas was rector of St. Michael&rsquo;s when he was
elected to this high office.</p>
<p class="tb">CATHEDRAL OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST, <i>122 Broad
Street</i>: John Morica England, first Bishop of Charleston, arrived
in Charleston December 30, 1820, and the Cathedral of
St. Finbar was dedicated by him a year later. It was a plain
frame structure. Thirty years it stood. Then it was razed for
the building of the St. John and St. Finbar Cathedral, burned
in 1861; it was similar in design to the present Cathedral of
St. John the Baptist on the same site, the northeast corner of
Broad and Legare Streets. This handsome Gothic edifice of
brown stone was begun late in 1888 by the Right Reverend
Henry Pinckney Northrop, Bishop of Charleston. April 14,
1907, it was consecrated, Cardinal Gibbons being one of the
celebrants. The site is that of the Vauxhall Gardens. Between
December, 1861, and the occupancy of the new cathedral, the
congregation worshipped in the pro-cathedral in Queen
Street, built by the Right Reverend Patrick Nielsen Lynch,
then Bishop of Charleston. St. John the Baptist&rsquo;s is 200 feet
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
long from the entrance to the rear of the vestry, the nave being
150 feet long by eighty feet wide; from the floor to the top
of clerestory is sixty feet. The interior is beautifully decorated
and contains fine paintings and stained-glass windows. To the
north of the Cathedral is the Convent of Our Lady of Mercy.
Graves of bishops are under the cathedral. The edifice is one
of Charleston&rsquo;s cardinal show places.</p>
<p class="tb">TRUMBULL&rsquo;S WASHINGTON, <i>in Charleston City
Hall</i>: One of the most famous and valuable portraits of
General George Washington hangs in the City Hall, northeast
corner of Meeting and Broad Streets. It was done by
John Trumbull on the order of the City Council in honor of
President Washington&rsquo;s visit in 1791. It is reputed to be worth
a million dollars! Art connoisseurs have come long distances
to inspect this great portrait. Washington is shown full
length, with his horse near him. While this is Charleston&rsquo;s
most valuable painting, there are other fine paintings in the
Municipal Gallery, including President James Monroe, commemorating
his visit in 1819, by Samuel F. B. Morse (inventor
of the telegraph); the damage done by a Union shell
in the 1860&rsquo;s does not show; President Andrew Jackson, in
uniform after the Battle of New Orleans, by Vanderlyn,
student under the celebrated Gilbert Stuart; General Zachary
Taylor, with spyglass in hand in Mexico, by Beard; John
Caldwell Calhoun, eminent statesman, addressing the United
States senate, by Healy; General William Moultrie, defender
of Fort Moultrie against Sir Peter Parker&rsquo;s British fleet in
1776, by Fraser; Marquis de Lafayette, miniature, by Fraser,
commemorating the Frenchman&rsquo;s visit in 1825; General
Francis Marion, the &ldquo;Swamp Fox,&rdquo; in Revolutionary uniform,
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
by John Stolle (here the famous coonskin cap is replaced by
a brigadier&rsquo;s hat, by order of William A. Courtenay, then
Mayor); Queen Anne, of England, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, a
fragment of the original cherished as a relic; Joel Roberts
Poinsett, statesman, by Jarvis; William Campbell Preston,
statesman, by Jarvis; General and Governor Wade Hampton,
the hero of Reconstruction, by Prescott; General P. G. T.
Beauregard, Confederate Chieftain, by Carter; General
Thomas A. Huguenin, the last Confederate commander of
Fort Sumter; statuary busts of James Louis Petigru, Robert
Young Hayne, Christopher Gustavus Memminger, Robert
Fulton, and others. An informing sketch of this gallery by
Joseph C. Barbot, Clerk of Council, is recommended. In
Colonial years the site of the City Hall was the town&rsquo;s market
place. On it the United States Bank was housed about 1802
and this building became the City Hall. It is related that the
money for the purchase came from the sale of the Exchange
to the United States government. The interior has been rearranged.</p>
<p class="tb">THE OLD EXCHANGE, <i>East End of Broad Street</i>: From
the standpoint of history, this building is incomparably the
most interesting in South Carolina and one of the most interesting
in America, the Rev. William Way, D.D., told the
Rebecca Motte Chapter of the Daughters of the American
Revolution, whose property it is by gift of the United States.
When Charles Town was laid out in 1680 this site was the
Court of Guards, the place of arms for the early colonists.
Here were imprisoned Stede Bonnet and other pirates in
1718 when South Carolina was putting down piracy after its
previous years of friendship and fraternizing. The Exchange
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
and Custom House was built in 1767 at a cost of 44,016
pounds. Most of the material was brought from England in
sailing vessels. The date of completion was 1771. Taxed tea
from England was stored in the Exchange in 1774 and citizens
prevented its sale. A second cargo, arriving November 3,
1774, was dumped by merchants of Charlestown into the
Cooper River. In July, 1774, delegates to the Provincial Congress
gathered in this building and set up the first independent
government established in America; the congress
also elected delegates to the General Congress meeting in
Philadelphia. Patriotic men and women of Charlestown were
incarcerated in the Exchange by the British during the Revolution;
it was from the Exchange that the martyr Colonel
Isaac Hayne was led to his execution in 1781. President
George Washington was entertained in the building, Charles
Fraser writing in his <i>Reminiscences</i>: &ldquo;Amidst every recollection
that I have of that most imposing occasion, the most
prominent is the person of that great man as he stood upon
the steps of the Exchange uncovered, amidst the enthusiastic
acclamation of the citizens.&rdquo; Saturday, May 7, 1791, General
Washington was guest of honor at a &ldquo;sumptuous entertainment&rdquo;
given by the merchants of Charleston in the Exchange.
During the War of 1812 patriotic meetings were held in the
Exchange. In 1818 the city of Charleston sold the Exchange
to the United States government for the sum of $60,000 and
a week later the city government paid the sum of $60,000 for
the building of the United States Bank, to be converted into
the City Hall. The following year President James Monroe
was in the Exchange. The federal government used the building
for a customhouse and post office, the customhouse
transferring to its own building after the War for Southern
Independence and the post office to its present home in 1896.
In the earthquake of 1886, the cupola designed by the artist
Fraser was so badly damaged that it was removed. For years
the building has been headquarters for the Sixth lighthouse
district; these offices continue in it although the government
has presented the historic building to the Daughters of the
American Revolution in and of the State of South Carolina
as an historical memorial, to be occupied by the Rebecca
Motte Chapter; this was effective in March of 1913. When
the United States entered the World War the Exchange by
unanimous vote of the D.A.R. was tendered the Federal
government which it used to the end of the conflict. On the
centennial of George Washington&rsquo;s death a handsome bronze
tablet on the west side of the Exchange was unveiled. There
is no question that this ante-Revolutionary building is one
of Charleston&rsquo;s greatest landmarks.</p>

<p class="tb">SITE OF INSTITUTE HALL, <i>134 Meeting Street</i>: South
Carolina declared itself free and independent, seceding from
the United States, December 20, 1860. This bold act was
taken in the hall of the South Carolina Institute. The <i>Ordinance
of Secession</i> had been adopted in the hall of the St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Society, 118 Broad Street, but the delegates came
to the Institute Hall because of its greater capacity; the wish
was to accommodate as many as possible of the thousands
who hoped to see the ordinance signed. With the great hall
crowded to suffocation, after all the signatures had been
affixed, President Jamison advanced to the front of the
rostrum and announced, that South Carolina was an independent
sovereignty, free of the United States. And the War
for Southern Independence was nascent. In this hall several
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
months before had been held the famous Democratic National
Convention that adjourned without decision with respect
to candidates for President and Vice President. On the
site are published <i>The News and Courier</i>, one of the oldest
daily newspapers in the United States, founded in 1803, with
its roots going back to 1786, and the <i>Charleston Evening
Post</i>. They carry on the traditions of the South.</p>
<p class="tb">CONFEDERATE MUSEUM, <i>at the Head of the Market</i>:
Valuable relics of the Confederacy are preserved in their hall
at the head of Market Street, at Meeting Street, by the
Charleston Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
A gun on the porch was fashioned from Swedish
wrought iron from one of the first locomotives operated by
the South Carolina Railroad, the world&rsquo;s oldest long-distance
steam railroad. It was among the first rifled cannon made in
the United States. This piece was in Columbia when General
William Tecumseh Sherman&rsquo;s Union troops occupied that
town, and Union soldiers tried to burst the cannon, cracking
it near the muzzle. During riots in the period of Reconstruction
the Washington Light Infantry manned the gun. The
Confederate Museum is in a hall over the west end of the
old City Market established between 1788 and 1804, extending
from East Bay Street to Meeting Street. Through many
years all household marketing was done in the stalls. Into
recent years it was a common sight to see a gentleman doing
the marketing, a negro with a large basket following him
from stall to stall. There survive stalls in the Market, but the
long low building is not congested as it was in other years.
The telephone has contributed much toward the discontinuance
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
of the good old Charleston custom of marketing in
person.</p>
<p class="tb">MARION SQUARE, <i>King, Meeting and Calhoun Streets</i>:
Named in honor of General Francis Marion, hero of the
Revolution, affectionately called the &ldquo;Swamp Fox,&rdquo; this six-acre
square in the very heart of Charleston was from 1882 to
1921 the parade ground of The Citadel, the military college
of South Carolina, giving rise to the nickname, Citadel Green.
The Citadel is now at Hampton Park, on the Ashley River,
but its main building and four wings stand as reminders. In
Lowndes Street, from Calhoun to the Citadel sally port, is a
statue of John Caldwell Calhoun, eminent South Carolina
statesman, atop a tall granite shaft. On the Meeting Street
side is a monument to General and Governor Wade Hampton,
savior of his State in Reconstruction, and on the west side
a section of &ldquo;horn work,&rdquo; part of the Revolutionary line of
fortifications for the defense of Charlestown against the invading
British. It was just outside the town, Boundary Street
becoming Calhoun Street after the town limits were extended
to their present line in 1849. Before the purchase by the now
defunct Fourth Brigade, the square was solidly built. After
the evacuation of Charleston until 1882 the United States
army was in possession of the Citadel buildings. On the east
side and on the west side are fountains fed by a great artesian
well near King and Calhoun Streets, formerly in the waterworks
system.</p>
<p class="tb">THE OLDEST DRUG STORE, <i>125 King Street</i>: America&rsquo;s
oldest drug store business is in Charleston. It has had
a career antedating 1781 as in that year Dr. Andrew Turnbull
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
bought the business and began the dispensing of his own
remedies. In 1792 Joseph Chouler was the proprietor, in 1806
William Burgoyne, in 1816 Jacob De La Motta. The mortar
and pestle he displayed over his Apothecary&rsquo;s Hall is still
extant, and in the store now used. Felix l&rsquo;Herminier took
over the business in 1845 and soon afterward it was in the
name of William G. Trott who in 1870 sold it to C. F.
Schwettmann. In 1894 the style was C. F. Schwettmann &amp;
Son. This continues with John F. Huchting as proprietor. In
1920 Mr. Huchting presented much of the old Apothecary&rsquo;s
Hall to the Charleston Museum which has reset it and where
it may be seen. More than one hundred and fifty years for a
drug business is a worth-while record!</p>
<p class="tb">CHARLESTON LIGHTHOUSE, <i>on Morris Island</i>: During
Colonial years the only coastal light south of the Delaware
capes was the Charleston Lighthouse on Morris Island,
built in 1767. The present tower was built in 1876; it is of
brick, 161 feet high. The earthquake of 1886 cracked the
tower and threw the lens out of adjustment. From the first
Charleston Light came a copper plate in the corner stone,
reading: &ldquo;The first stone of this Beacon was laid on the 30th
of May 1767 in the seventh year of His Majesty&rsquo;s reign,
George the III,&rdquo; and so on. December 18, 1860, the first incident
of the War for Southern Independence affecting the
lighthouse service occurred at the Charleston Light. The
Secretary of the Treasury was told by the Secretary of the
Lighthouse Board that he would not recommend that the
coast of South Carolina &ldquo;be lighted by the Federal Government
against her will.&rdquo; December 30, the lighthouse inspector
reported that &ldquo;the Governor of the State of South Carolina
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
has requested me to leave the State.&rdquo; By the latter part of
April, 1861, the Confederates had extinguished this and other
lights; they were furnishing no aids to navigation for Union
mariners. Morris Island is at the left entrance to the harbor
of Charleston. From the eastern end of the Folly Beach, accessible
by automobile, a clear view of the Charleston Light
may be had.</p>
<p class="tb">MIDDLETON PLACE, <i>Gardens on the Ashley River</i>:
This was the seat of Arthur Middleton, Signer of the <i>Declaration
of Independence</i>. Henry Middleton, of The Oaks,
president of the Continental Congress, obtained the land
through his wife. Two English landscape gardeners were
brought oversea to fashion the show place, which was completed
about 1740. The fine Tudor house was put to the
torch late in the War for Southern Independence. Only the
left wing stands, and in it the owner, J. J. Pringle Smith,
descendant of the Signer, lives. The old steps to the main
building are in place, and from them a commanding view
of the broad formal terraces and the winding Ashley River
is had. The first japonicas brought into this country were
transplanted at Middleton Place about 1805 and one of the
original plants was alive in 1939. Middleton Place is famous
not only for its gorgeous azalea show in spring, but for the
wide variety of plants. It has been praised with lavish enthusiasm
by distinguished visitors. Annually thousands of
people travel many miles to walk about these wonderful
gardens, a living reminder of the beauty wrought before
the Revolution. The grave of the Signer is at Middleton
Place. The Gardens are on the Ashley River Road, about
fourteen miles from the Ashley River Bridge. If one would
see gardens, terraces and hedges substantially as they were
in 1740; if one would see one of the world&rsquo;s most beautiful
places, he should be sure of visiting Middleton Place.</p>

<p class="tb">MAGNOLIA GARDENS, <i>on the Ashley River</i>: Distinguished
authors have heaped glowing compliments on the
enchantment that is Magnolia-on-the-Ashley, &ldquo;a sight unrivalled,&rdquo;
said a writer in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. The fame of
these gardens has gone wide and far. Thomas P. Lesesne, of
Charleston, was in the great Kew Gardens, London. Coming
to the azalea section he was surprised to find a sign declaring
to all who came that way that if one would see the azalea in
the zenith of its beauty, he should visit Magnolia-on-the-Ashley,
near Charleston, South Carolina, United States of
America! In Kew! Think of that! John Galsworthy, Owen
Wister and other notables have shed superlatives in describing
the gardens. In this show place on the Ashley River, the
Reverend John Grimke Drayton planted the first <i>Azalea
Indica</i>. They had been imported from the East to Philadelphia
in 1843, but, the Pennsylvania climate being too rigorous for
them, Mr. Drayton was invited to see what he could do with
them. And what he has done with them brings thousands of
people from distant places each spring when the azaleas are
in the full glory of their bloom! The gardens, about twenty-five
acres in extent, have what is declared to be the most valuable
collection of the Camellia Japonica; there are more than
250 varieties. They come into bloom in the winter, and the
gardens are open for their inspection. Carlisle Norwood Hastie,
present owner of Magnolia, is grandson of the Reverend
Mr. Drayton, an Episcopalian minister. Two hundred years
the property has been in possession of the Drayton family.
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
During the Revolution the Colonial mansion was burned and
a second building was burned during the War for Southern
Independence. Mr. Hastie has purchased the old Tupper
house in Charleston (its site on Meeting Street) for r&euml;erection
at Magnolia-on-Ashley. Moss-covered oak and cypress
trees, bordering mirroring lagoons, furnish a bewitching background
for the gardens, with the Ashley River in front.</p>
<p class="tb">ASHLEY RIVER BRIDGE, <i>on the Coastal Highway (17)</i>:
Until the first of July, 1921, the bridge over the Ashley River
at the head of Spring Street was privately owned. At that
time the county of Charleston acquired it by purchase and at
once the toll was taken off. In the spring of 1926, the present
handsome and commodious concrete bridge was formally
opened. It is slightly down-stream from the rather ramshackle
wooden bridge. It cost a million and a quarter dollars.
It is wide enough for four vehicles abreast and on each side
is a sidewalk for pedestrians. Its huge bascule leaves provide
plenty of clearance for the greatest seagoing vessels. This
bridge, a memorial to Charleston soldiers who lost their lives
in the World War, is an essential link in the Coastal Highway
between the provinces of eastern Canada and the keys of
Florida, thence by &ldquo;ferry&rdquo; to Havana, Cuba. It connects the
city of Charleston with all the trans-Ashley region. From the
town it leads to James Island (on which are the Country Club
and the Municipal Links, Riverland Terrace and Wappoo
Hall) and the popular Folly Beach; by way of James Island to
the Stono River bridge which is near the famous Fenwick
Hall, a great estate in pre-Revolutionary years; it leads to
Walterboro, Beaufort, Port Royal (site of the earliest French
colony) and Savannah and Jacksonville; it leads to the Ashley
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
River Road for St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church, Middleton Place, Magnolia-on-the-Ashley,
Drayton Hall, Runnymede, Wragg
Barony and Bacon&rsquo;s Bridge over the upper Ashley River. In
the War Between the States the old bridge was burned and
after Appomattox more than fifteen years elapsed before it
was restored. Near the Ashley River Bridge in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Parish are sites of the earliest English plantations. Quite near
it Eliza Lucas, daughter of the Governor of Antigua and
mother of the Generals Charles Cotesworth and Thomas
Pinckney, carried forward her indigo experiments. David
Ramsay says that the indigo planters doubled their capital
every three or four years.</p>
<p class="tb">COOPER RIVER BRIDGE, <i>on the Old King&rsquo;s Highway</i>:
Coming to Charleston President George Washington, President
James Monroe and the Marquis de Lafayette traveled
over the old King&rsquo;s Highway. Washington was here in 1791,
Monroe in 1819 and Lafayette in 1825. From the Mount
Pleasant shore to the City of Charleston they crossed by
primitive ferry. To August of 1929 ferries over the broad
Cooper River were continued. In that month the great bridge
over the Cooper River was opened to traffic. This is the
world&rsquo;s third highest vehicular bridge! Its span over Town
Creek affords vertical clearance of 132 feet, as much as that
of the famous Brooklyn Bridge, and the span over the Cooper
River a vertical clearance of 152 feet at mean high water.
From the crest of this engineering achievement are provided
commanding views. In the distance to the right is Fort Sumter,
looking for all the world like a toy fortress in a toy pool.
From this coign of vantage one sees the many bold and little
creeks that flow into the Cooper. To the middle left one sees
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
the heavy woods of Christ Church Parish. Give the imagination
rein and appear ghosts of almost naked Indians, of
early English, French, Irish, Scotch; of bitter conflicts of man
against man; of Sir Peter Parker and his naval armada smiting
the little palmetto fort with shot and shell. At Charleston,
over the Cooper River Bridge the old Kings Highway makes
junction with the Coastal Highway. It is the short route from
Charleston to Georgetown, Wilmington, Norfolk, crossing
the lower Santee and other bold coastal streams almost within
sight of the sea. There is every promise that the old King&rsquo;s
Highway, paved, will develop into a paramount route between
East and Southeast, an important alternate to the
Coastal Highway. No visitor to Charleston should forego the
opportunity of passing over the three-mile Cooper River
Bridge. It is a sensation well worth the trivial Journey.</p>
<p class="tb">THE CITADEL, <i>the Military College of South Carolina</i>:
General Charles Pelot Summerall is now a Charlestonian and
proud of it. He would add that his pride is the greater in that
he is president of The Citadel, the military college of South
Carolina, an institution whose illustrious record goes back to
1842, which furnished distinguished officers for the Confederacy,
in the Spanish and World Wars. As the Cadet Battalion
went into the Confederate service the college was
closed in 1864. From the evacuation of Charleston to The
Citadel&rsquo;s reopening in 1882, it was occupied by Union
soldiers. From its establishment in 1842 to the fall of 1922,
The Citadel was on Marion Square. Because it needed more
room, it went into new quarters at Hampton Park on the
Ashley River where now it is. It was a cadet battery that fired
the first gun of the War for Southern Independence; the
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
Union ship <i>Star of the West</i> was driven off while attempting
to bring supplies to the garrison besieged in Fort Sumter.
Year after year the War Department of the United States
designates The Citadel as a distinguished military college.
Its academic standards are high.</p>
<p class="tb">PORTER MILITARY ACADEMY, <i>Distinguished Military
School</i>: &ldquo;Through the noble efforts&rdquo; of the Reverend
Anthony Toomer Porter, D.D., then Rector of the Episcopal
Church of the Holy Communion, the Porter Military Academy
had its origin in 1867 as the Holy Communion Church
Institute, in its genesis &ldquo;a classical school for the children
of parents in straitened circumstances,&rdquo; due to the War for
Southern Independence. In Dr. Porter&rsquo;s absence his board of
trustees named the institution for him. Among its distinguished
alumni is General Charles Pelot Summerall,
former Chief of Staff of the United States Army and now
President of The Citadel. The Porter Military Academy occupies
the grounds of the United States Arsenal; it is bounded
by Ashley Avenue and Bee, President and Doughty Streets.
It continues to earn a high place among Southern educational
institutions, its boarding cadets coming from many States. It
is a fully accredited preparatory school.</p>
<p class="tb">COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON, <i>Oldest Municipal College</i>:
To claim the distinction of being America&rsquo;s oldest municipal
college is a large order, but the College of Charleston,
on George Street between St. Philip and College Streets,
earns it by the record. The institution was founded in 1770
and takes rank as fifteenth in the list of American colleges.
Its roll of graduates sounds like a list of South Carolina&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
illustrious: John C. Fremont, explorer and candidate for the
presidency; James B. DeBow, ante-bellum economist; Edward
McCrady, historian; Bishop William Wightman, of the
Methodist Episcopal Church; Bishop Bowen, of the Protestant
Episcopal Church; William H. Trescott, diplomat; Paul
Hamilton Hayne, poet; Chancellor Henry Deas Lesesne;
United States Judge Henry A. M. Smith, historian and
scholar; the Rev. J. L. Girardeau, eminent Presbyterian minister.
On its governing board have served such distinguished
men as James Louis Petigru, Robert Young Hayne, John
Julius Pringle, Daniel Elliott Huger, Langdon Cheves, Henry
Middleton, General William Washington, Joel Roberts Poinsett,
Judge Mitchell King. In 1837 the college was taken over
by the Corporation of Charleston; it is the oldest municipal
college in America. Among the founders of the College of
Charleston were the ablest men in the Royal Province of
South Carolina, among them two Signers of the <i>Declaration
of Independence</i> (Arthur Middleton and Thomas Heyward,
Jr.) and three Signers of the <i>Constitution of the United States</i>
(Charles Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and John
Rutledge, &ldquo;The Dictator&rdquo;).</p>

<p class="tb">ORIGINAL DEPARTMENT STORE, <i>King Street at
Market</i>: &ldquo;Ghosts rush out every time I pass,&rdquo; said a friend.
He was growing sentimental about the Academy of Music
building, razed in 1937. In 1830 in this &ldquo;whale of a building,&rdquo;
for its time, was opened the world&rsquo;s first department store.
With great stocks from all parts of the world the Kerrisons
built up an enormous business, their customers coming from
as far as the Mississippi River! It was a massive building of
massive construction. Its masonry was notable and it may be
that its great heart cypress timbers were more notable. To
the coming of the War for Southern Independence, Charleston
being capital of a far-flung slave empire, business in the
building prospered. Kerrison&rsquo;s of this time is descendant of
the original Kerrison&rsquo;s; it is across and higher up King Street,
one of the leading department stores of the South. After
Appomattox Charleston was without a theater. The Charleston
Theater had been destroyed in the fire of 1861. John
Chadwick, a school master, acquired the building and converted
the rear portion into a theater, the Academy of Music,
wherein have appeared famous actors, actresses and singers,
great bands and orchestras. Georges Barrere, solo flautist and
conductor of the Little Symphony Orchestra and the Barrere
Ensemble, after playing his flute on the stage, remarked:
&ldquo;Here is a veritable &lsquo;Strad.&rsquo; of a theater!&rdquo; Barrere was justly
complimenting the remarkable acoustics of the theater. It is
well to bear in mind that Charleston had a great department
store before the first of the steam railroads began operation
in America! A century ago in a mezzanine gallery on the top
floor were displayed laces, embroideries and other fine goods
from the world&rsquo;s finest makers. As a theater the Academy of
Music was owned for some years by John A. Owens, nationally
known for his portrayal of Solon Shingle. It may be permissible
here to say that Joseph Jefferson used to manage a
theater in Charleston, that his mother was born in Charleston.</p>
<p class="tb">WASHINGTON SQUARE, <i>Called also City Hall Park</i>:
In the northwest corner of this park is the first fireproof
building built in America, for which salient reason Charleston
knows it as The Fireproof Building. It was erected
about 1826. Robert Mills was the architect. It is used for
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
county offices and records. In the southwest corner is the
City Hall which is discussed elsewhere. On Broad, Meeting
and Chalmers Streets are handsome wrought-iron gates and
wrought-iron railings of great grace. In the center of the
park is a shaft of granite to the three companies of the
Washington Light Infantry which served the Confederacy
valiantly on the battlefields of Virginia in the 60&rsquo;s, and in
the defense of Charleston. Southward of this is a bust to
the lilting Carolina poet, Henry Timrod, and eastward a
monument to General Pierre G. T. Beauregard, for some
time in the War for Southern Independence, commanding
officer at Charleston. New Orleans paid tribute to this illustrious
soldier long after Charleston had done so. Near the
west gate is the statue of William Pitt.</p>
<p class="tb">WILLIAM PITT STATUE, <i>in Washington Park</i>: &ldquo;The
gentleman (Benjamin Franklin) tells us that America is
obstinate, America is almost in open rebellion. Sir, I rejoice
that America has resisted! Three millions of people so dead
to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be
slaves would have been fit instruments to make slaves of
all the rest!&rdquo; William Pitt was speaking in the House of
Commons, London, denouncing the iniquitous stamp tax.
Charlestown heard of the Pitt speech and Charlestown
applauded. Charlestown ordered a statue of the great statesman
in recognition of his noble position. The statue was
received in Charlestown May 31, 1770, and was erected in
the intersection of Broad and Meeting Streets, the most
prominent position in the town at that time. During the
Revolution a shell from a British gun on James Island
struck off the right arm, explaining its absence into this
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
day. Years afterward, interfering with traffic, it was removed
to the yard of the Charleston Orphan House and in
1881, through the Carolina Art Association, placed where
now it is in Washington Park.</p>
<p class="tb">LORD CAMPBELL&rsquo;S HOUSE, <i>34 Meeting Street</i>: Last
of the Royal Governors, Lord William Campbell, precipitately
left Charlestown September 16, 1775, taking refuge
aboard H.M.S. <i>Tamar</i>. Lord Campbell by night went
through his garden to a boat in Vanderhorst Creek (Water
Street nowadays). He had come to Charlestown June 18,
1775, and was &ldquo;received civilly, but without enthusiasm.&rdquo;
Fleeing, he carried with him the Great Seal of the Province.
South Carolina was on the way to independence. The
house was built about 1760 and was owned by Mrs. Blake,
first cousin to Sarah Izard who married Lord Campbell.
She belonged to one of the richest and most influential
families in the Province. After the Revolution, about 1795,
Colonel Lewis Morris, a Revolutionary officer, acquired the
property. Colonel Francis Kinloch Huger, who had part
in the frustrated plot to liberate the Marquis de Lafayette
from the Austrian prison of Olmutz, was wounded on the
steps of this house; a section of the bull&rsquo;s-eye in the roof fell
and fractured his skull. In the earthquake of 1886, a young
Englishman was killed on the steps; a piece of the parapet
fell on him. The house has been in the Huger family for
years. The handsome piazzas on the south side were built
for the late William E. Huger, whose son, Daniel Elliott
Huger, is the present owner.</p>
<p class="tb">WILLIAM BULL&rsquo;S HOUSE, <i>35 Meeting Street</i>: Across
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
Meeting Street from the Charlestown home of Lord William
Campbell was the home of the first Lieutenant Governor
of the Royal Province of South Carolina, William Bull,
who is said to have erected it; he died in 1755. It was his
son, William Bull, then also Lieutenant Governor who was
occupying it at the outbreak of the Revolution. The office
of Lieutenant Governor was devised to safeguard against
an interregnum between the naming of Governors by the
King of England.</p>
<p class="tb">MILES BREWTON HOUSE, <i>27 King Street</i>: History,
romance, legend and tradition crowd upon this famous
mansion, built by Miles Brewton about 1765. Brewton and
his family perished at sea and the property descended to
his sister, the famous Mrs. Rebecca Motte (whose name is
perpetuated in the Rebecca Motte Chapter of the Daughters
of the American Revolution). This gallant and patriotic
lady was living in the house when the British took possession
of Charleston. Sir Henry Clinton commandeered it as
his headquarters, and Lord Rawdon did the same thing.
Lord Cornwallis was quartered in the house. Again, when
the Union forces occupied Charleston in the War for Southern
Independence, the general commanding set up his
headquarters here. Later the house was the residence of
the Pringle family, hence it is commonly known nowadays
as the Pringle House. The visitor should observe the picturesque
old coach house adjoining and to the north. The
old garden is behind high brick walls, so typical of the old
Charlestown. Her home in possession of the invading
British, Rebecca Brewton Motte, widow of Jacob Motte,
retired with his family to her plantation house in Orangeburg
County on the Congaree River. The British, seizing
the residence, built a parapet around it. Francis Marion
and Henry Lee laid siege to it. Apprised that British reinforcements
were approaching, the officers considered the
burning of the fine property, but hesitated. Mrs. Motte,
however, overcame their scruples. Bringing out an African
bow and arrows for it, she deliberately sent flaming arrows to
the roof which caught afire, causing the British garrison to
surrender with alacrity. After independence Mrs. Motte undertook
rice planting on scale and built up a considerable
property. Her two eldest daughters, in succession, were wives
of the great Thomas Pinckney.</p>

<p class="tb">WILLIAM GIBBES HOUSE, <i>64 South Battery Street</i>:
William Gibbes came to Charlestown direct from England
and was active in behalf of the colonies until the actual break
with the Crown, when he fled to Bermuda, thence going back
to England. The handsome house was built before 1776; the
exact date is obscured. Gibbes was with others interested in
reclaiming marshy areas in that section. Five years after his
death the records show that Mrs. Sarah Smithe purchased
the property, the consideration being twenty-five hundred
pounds. An elegant ballroom occupies the width of the upper
story. Within brick walls on three sides was, and is, a beautiful
garden. For years the property belonged to the Drayton
family and some years after the War for Southern Independence
it was occupied by James Petigru Lesesne, son of the
Chancellor Henry Deas Lesesne and a great-grandson of the
Huguenot pastor, Jean Louis Gibert who came from the
Channel Islands leading a French colony into upper South
Carolina. It passed into the ownership of Colonel J. B. E.

<p class="tb">WILLIAM BLACKLOCK HOUSE, <i>18 Bull Street</i>: This
fine mansion, built about 1800, is considered one of the best
examples of its type of architecture. It is a two-story brick
dwelling, with a double set of steps leading to an entrance
platform. The carriage gates are gracefully ornate. There is
the peculiarity that the gates are of wood, rather than of the
wrought-iron pieces that would be expected.</p>
<p class="tb">THE WASHINGTON HOUSE, <i>87 Church Street</i>: President
George Washington, visiting Charleston in May, 1791,
was &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; in the residence of Thomas Heyward, Jr.,
one of the four South Carolina Signers of the <i>Declaration of
Independence</i>. Edward Rutledge, also a Signer of the <i>Declaration</i>,
was of the company that greeted the soldier-statesman
across the Cooper River and escorted him to town. A complete
equipment was organized by the City of Charleston for the
President&rsquo;s comfort. The house has undergone changes. For
some years a baker did business on the ground floor. The
property is now owned and maintained by the Society for the
Preservation of Old Dwellings. Down the street and on the
opposite side at No. 78, President Washington addressed
citizens from the balcony, which is a graceful reminder of
the French influence in Charleston.</p>
<p class="tb">MYTHICAL OLD SLAVE MARKET, <i>6 Chalmers Street</i>:
Chalmers in this year is fairly famous for two things: It is
Charleston&rsquo;s surviving &ldquo;cobble-stone&rdquo; street, the stones coming
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
in ballast from European shores in the old sailing days,
and on it is a building that tourists are told was the old Slave
Market. The myth has been exploded repeatedly, but it persists,
and since there are no black slaves it probably doesn&rsquo;t
matter. Authorities are positive in saying that nowhere in
Charleston was there a constituted slave market for the public
auctioning of blacks from Africa. Several houses in this
vicinity were used in olden times to quarter slaves who were
to be sold on the block. Authorities also agree, propagandists
to the contrary notwithstanding, that the black slaves in the
South were in better care than were the peasantry in any other
part of the world.</p>
<p class="tb">CHARLESTON LIBRARY, <i>164 King Street</i>: Organized
in 1748 by seventeen young gentlemen of Charlestown, third
oldest in this country, the Charleston Library Society, a private
enterprise governed by a Board of Trustees, moved into
a new fireproof building in recent years. In 1835 the society
bought the building of the old South Carolina Bank, at the
northwest corner of Broad and Church Streets, using this until
the transfer to King Street. The society has more than
60,000 volumes. It owns the only surviving file of the <i>South
Carolina State Gazette</i> and one of three files of <i>The Courier</i>
(1803). Valuable books were lost in the fire of 1778. In the
War for Southern Independence most of the volumes were
taken to Columbia for safekeeping; those left in the society&rsquo;s
building were destroyed. In 1874 the old Apprentices&rsquo; Society
was merged with the Charleston Library Society. In
1900, dissolving, the South Carolina Jockey Club transferred
its property to the library; the club and the society were about
of an age. Generous bequests have greatly assisted the society.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p class="tb">CHARLESTON MUSEUM, <i>123 Rutledge Avenue</i>: This,
the oldest Museum in the country, is housed in the former
Thomson Auditorium, built in 1899 for conventions, with
money bequeathed by John Thomson. The Charlestown Museum
was organized in 1773 and incorporated in 1915. Very
fine collections of natural history and of the history of human
culture are owned. Lately the Museum had the great good
fortune to come into possession of the priceless collection of
birds preserved by the distinguished South Carolina ornithologist,
Arthur Trezevant Wayne. A skeleton of a large
whale which found its way into Charleston harbor and was
harpooned is one of the Museum&rsquo;s unique specimens, unique
in that the cetacean was caught in this harbor.</p>
<p class="tb">THE BATTERY, <i>White Point Gardens</i>: It is no use to call
the Battery by its proper name; even in Charleston, White
Point Gardens is not recognized as the Battery. Nonetheless
the name of this famous and beautiful park and promenade
is White Point Gardens. Its sea walls are laved on the south
by the Ashley River and on the east by the Cooper River; their
confluence is at and off the southeast corner of the Battery.
This pleasure ground has been favorably compared with the
world&rsquo;s most famous plazas and promenades. It is a source
of never-ending delight to visitors. East, or High Battery begins
at the old Granville Bastion, now Omar Temple of the
Mystic Shrine. It is a great promenade, with a commanding
view of the harbor seaward, with Fort Sumter in the middle-ground.
South Battery, proper, is between the East Battery
and the extension of King Street to the water. Somewhat
more than eight acres constitute South Battery, which, to the
westward, becomes the Murray Boulevard, lined, as East and
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
South Battery are, with fine residences. In its origin East Battery
had a wall of palmetto logs with a plank walk on top. It
was swept away in the great gale of 1804. William Crafts,
Jr., originated the first stone wall, with rock ballast from incoming
ships as &ldquo;riprap&rdquo; to strengthen the wall. The work
was completed before 1820. In the War of 1812 guns were
emplaced along East Battery, thus, it is held, accounting for
its name, The Battery. Fort Broughton and Fort Mechanic
have long since disappeared. Fort Street became South Bay
Street and later South Battery for its whole length from East
Battery through the Boulevard area to the junction with
Tradd Street a mile away. It was in 1830 that the first steps
toward creating a beautiful pleasure ground were taken. By
1852 White Point Gardens was an accomplished fact. Fine
oak and palmetto trees enhance the attractiveness of the Battery.
Years ago a bathhouse was removed. The monument
to the defenders of Fort Moultrie, commonly called the Sergeant
Jasper monument because of the figure of a soldier
rescuing the flag, was unveiled June 28 (Carolina Day),
1876, the hundredth anniversary of the repulse of Sir Peter
Parker&rsquo;s British fleet. The monument to William Gilmore
Simms, editor, author and historian, was erected in June,
1879. At the foot of Meeting Street is a memorial fountain
to the men of the first submarine, Confederates. Facing Fort
Sumter is a monument to the defenders of Fort Sumter. On
the Battery are relics of all the wars Charleston has seen, the
Spanish War being represented by the capstan of the battleship
<i>Maine</i>, destroyed in Havana harbor in 1898. To visit
Charleston and not to see the Battery is unthinkable. From
time to time concerts are given in the band stand. The late
Andrew B. Murray contributed generously to the improvement
of the Battery and of the driveway named in his honor.</p>

<p class="tb">THE COLONIAL COMMON, <i>and Ashley River Embankment</i>:
In Charleston beautiful Colonial Lake is The Pond. It
came into being in the 1880&rsquo;s with the reclaiming of the area.
The official designation is The Colonial Common and Ashley
River Embankment. About this salt-water pond are garden
areas, and west of it is the new Moultrie Playground which
greatly improves the appearance of the neighborhood. Some
of Charleston&rsquo;s most desirable residences face the pond. Off
its northwest corner is the Baker Sanatorium, one of the
South&rsquo;s largest and most completely equipped private hospitals,
founded by Archibald E. Baker, surgeon. Less than
fifty years ago there was a causeway at the head of Broad
Street; nowadays the whole area is populated. Colonial Lake
is bounded by Broad Street, Rutledge Avenue, Beaufain
Street, and Ashley Avenue, paramount traffic arteries. Its
water is from the Ashley River, regulated by a flood-gate.</p>
<p class="tb">MEDICAL COLLEGE, <i>16 Lucas Street</i>: While the Medical
College of the State of South Carolina dates from 1823,
it did not move to the present site until 1913. For years before
that it was in Queen Street. The college maintains schools
of medicine, pharmacy and nursing. <i>The News and Courier</i>
is quoted: &ldquo;The early faculty included men of national and
international reputation, who gave the college a prestige
which placed it at once amongst the foremost institutions of
the kind, and among its graduates were not a few whose fame
added further luster to their alma mater.... The sessions
of the college were carried on without intermission until the
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
outbreak of the War Between the States when lectures had to
be discontinued. In 1865 the college was reopened, and in
spite of adverse conditions has been in successful operation
ever since.&rdquo; In the session of the Legislature in 1913 the college
passed under State control.</p>
<p class="tb">THE ROPER HOSPITAL, <i>15 Lucas Street</i>: On the site of
the old City Hospital is the Roper Hospital; riverward is its
auxiliary pavilion, the Riverside Infirmary, a high-class private
hospital. The Roper is a general hospital operated by the
Medical Society of South Carolina, the City of Charleston
and the County of Charleston contributing to the care of
&ldquo;free&rdquo; patients. The institution includes a special building
for contagious diseases. The hospital owes its origin to the
benevolence of Colonel Thomas Roper. In 1849 the Medical
Society proceeded to arrange the building of a hospital,
&ldquo;prompted by the deficient and faulty hospital accommodations
of the city at that time.&rdquo; The City Council appropriated
$20,000 and a lot was acquired at Queen and Mazyck Streets.
Public spirited citizens swelled the building fund. The building
was completed in 1852. Before it was completely furnished
and equipped, it had to be opened because of the
yellow fever epidemic that raged in 1852. In effect, the old
Roper Hospital was leased to the City of Charleston, the arrangement
between the Board of Trustees and the City
Council beginning in 1856 and terminating in 1865. With
the evacuation of Charleston by the Confederates, the Union
invaders took it over; its trustees were impotent. Next to the
Roper, the city improvised and operated its own hospital,
and the Roper trustees closed their institution in 1871. The
city hospital was virtually destroyed in the earthquake of
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
1886. The City Council had it transferred to Lucas Street.
On this site the present Roper building was erected. It has
been greatly enlarged in the last twenty years. Nurses&rsquo; homes
are on the property, the student nurses being enrolled at the
Medical College.</p>
<p class="tb">ASHLEY HALL, <i>172 Rutledge Avenue</i>: Originally one of
the historic mansions of Charleston, Ashley Hall, a preparatory
school for young ladies, draws its students from many
states. In the language of Miss Mary Vardrine McBee,
founder and principal: &ldquo;It is but a little while since Ashley
Hall was a venturous experiment. Begun in the conviction
that South Carolina and her sister States were ready to welcome
a school for girls of high intellectual standing, while
cherishing still those amenities of feminine culture which give
Southern life its distinctive charm, Ashley Hall was welcomed
in its very inception. It had hardly been opened before the
necessity of enlargement, alike of building and staff, became
apparent.&rdquo; The grounds about this fine mansion are among
the most beautiful in the South. Annually a Shakespearean
play is performed in the garden, the students portraying the
r&ocirc;les.</p>
<p class="tb">PRINCESS LOUISE, <i>Site of the Landing Stage</i>: Princess
Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria, was in Charleston January
19-24, 1883, first member of the English Royal family to
come to the capital of the former Royal Province. She was accompanied
by her husband, the Marquis of Lorne, then Governor
General of Canada, later the Duke of Argyle. In residence
at the Charleston Hotel she received &ldquo;pleasantly a
number of our citizens, both ladies and gentlemen.&rdquo; For her
convenience a landing stage was provided at the foot of King
Street, on the Battery (the Fort Sumter Hotel is on this site).
As the Princess was about to embark on H.M.S. <i>Dido</i>, the
Battery was &ldquo;densely crowded with people, including a number
of ladies.&rdquo; The German Artillery fired a salute and the
<i>Dido</i> answered. &ldquo;The pure splendor of the Japonicas,&rdquo; said
<i>The News and Courier</i>, &ldquo;reminded the Princess of the old
home at Osborne, where so much of her young life was
spent.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">H. A. MIDDLETON&rsquo;S HOUSE, <i>68 South Battery Street</i>:
Henry Augustus Middleton, of the illustrious Middleton
family, died in Charleston in March, 1887, in his ninety-fifth
year. He was at the time of his death, <i>The News and
Courier</i> said, &ldquo;the oldest living representative of a family
which for more than two centuries has been closely and
prominently identified with the history of South Carolina....
He was a school boy when Marengo was being fought
and was a young man whose education was finished when the
great Napoleon closed his career at Waterloo.&rdquo; The same
newspaper further said that Mr. Middleton &ldquo;was a conspicuous
representative of a society and class which are fast passing
into tradition.&rdquo; He was owner and operator of many great
plantations, and before the War for Southern Independence
among the leading owners of slaves. He married Harriott,
daughter of Cleland Kinloch, of Wee Haw, in Georgetown
County. The fine old property is now owned by Dr. W. J.
Pettus. Through Mr. Middleton&rsquo;s life and for twenty-five
years thereafter the sea wall on the west side of the yard was
washed by the Ashley River at high tide. The marsh expanse
to the west is in the Boulevard area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p class="tb">ST. FRANCIS XAVIER INFIRMARY, <i>264 Calhoun Street</i>:
The principal building of the St. Francis Xavier Infirmary
was built in the bishopric of the Right Reverend
William Thomas Russell, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Charleston, but the wing on Ashley Avenue is much older.
Sisters of Mercy have supervision over the Xavier in all its
departments, including the school for nurses. The hospital
enjoys high rating by the national hospital authorities. The
building is commodious, convenient and fireproof.</p>
<p class="tb">LIBERTY TREE SITE, <i>22 North Alexander Street</i>:
The Liberty Tree in old Mazyckboro under which Christopher
Gadsden, William Johnson and others impatient with English
treatment of the colonies met and debated has gone, but a
tablet marks the site. The inscription reads: &ldquo;Near this spot
once stood the Liberty Tree where Colonial independence was
first advocated by Christopher Gadsden, A.D. 1766, and where
ten years later the <i>Declaration of Independence</i> was first
heard and applauded by South Carolinians.&rdquo; This tablet was
erected by the Sons of the Revolution in 1905. It was under
the tree in a pasture that patriots nurtured high treason
against the English Crown.</p>
<p class="tb">WILLIAM WASHINGTON HOUSE, <i>8 South Battery Street</i>:
Here lived Colonel William Washington, a Virginian,
who achieved distinction in the Revolution, mainly in South
Carolina. The fine old house was built by Thomas Savage
about 1769 and was purchased by Colonel Washington after
independence had been recognized. His fianc&eacute;e, member of a
proud South Carolina family, presented him with a flag when
she learned he had none. It was a piece taken from a handsome
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
drapery of red silk and became known as the Eutaw flag,
for the Battle of Eutaw Springs. In 1827 Mrs. Washington,
his widow, gave this battle-stained banner to the Washington
Light Infantry which now owns it. Latterly the property has
been owned by Julian Mitchell, outstanding lawyer, president
of the South Carolina National Bank.</p>
<p class="tb">HAMPTON PARK, <i>Head of Cleveland Street</i>: Notwithstanding
its comparative youth Hampton Park, named for
General Wade Hampton, is a distinguished pleasure ground,
its gardens developed to a high state of loveliness. Some time
after the South Carolina, Inter-State and West Indian Exposition
(1901-02) the city took over the property and developed
it into a modern park. Its sunken garden, with ducks and
geese and swans playing in the water, is appealing, and about
it on all sides are flower beds, profusely beautiful in their
seasons. Large canebreaks are growing near the sunken garden.
An attractive driveway goes about the property, but
vehicles are not permitted within the garden area. A section
of the tract, bordering the Ashley River, was ceded to The
Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina, after the
World War. A stroll through Hampton Park&rsquo;s flowers in
spring and summer is thoroughly worth while. Features include
a zoo and an aviary.</p>
<p class="tb">COUNTY COURT HOUSE, <i>Broad and Meeting Streets</i>:
In years when Charleston was Charles Town, when Indians
were roaming these coastal woods, the State House stood at
the northwest corner of Broad and Meeting Streets. It was
burned in 1788, after Columbia, on the Congaree, had become
the capital of the State. Not long after the fire the county
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
built its court house here. The building was renovated and
enlarged several years ago, the court room being in the annex.
Records running back to the Proprietary era are in the offices
of the Clerk of Court. A legend persists that the Court House
is the old State House, but it is a mistaken legend, for it
was burned in 1788. From its entrance Governor John Rutledge
first read the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">UNITED STATES POST OFFICE, <i>Broad and Meeting
Streets</i>: Since 1896 the United States post office has been in
the granite building at the southwest corner of Broad and
Meeting Streets, on the site of the old (police) Guard House
which suffered heavy damage in the earthquake of 1886.
Southward of the building is an attractive park which is not
open to the public. The United States court and its officials
and attach&eacute;s have quarters in the building. Previously the
post office was in the old Exchange, at the foot of Broad Street.
On the four corners of Broad and Meeting Streets are: Southwest,
post office; southeast, St. Michael&rsquo;s Episcopal Church,
on the site of the first English church; northeast, City Hall,
the building erected for the United States Bank; on the site
of an early market place; northwest, County Court House, on
the site of the old State House. (Consult the <a href="#c5">Index</a>.)</p>
<p class="tb">UNITED STATES CUSTOMS HOUSE, <i>East Bay Street,
at Market</i>: Work on this, one of the handsomest government
buildings, was begun in 1850 and was proceeding when the
War for Southern Independence interrupted. After Appomattox
it was completed, but it is much smaller than the
original plans prescribed, explaining the fine esplanade effect
in front. It is a Roman-Corinthian building of white marble,
and its steps, both front and back, have elicited warm admiration
from appreciative visitors. Piles, grillage and concrete
were used in the foundations. The building houses the customs
service, the army engineer offices, the weather bureau,
the public health surgeon, the immigration service, the internal
revenue offices and the bureau of steamboat inspection.
In the basement from time to time are stored quantities of
&ldquo;contraband&rdquo; confiscated by the Coast Guard and other federal
prohibition agents. Prior to 1850 the old Fitzsimmons
wharf was on the site of the Customs House quay.</p>

<p class="tb">SOUTH CAROLINA HALL, <i>72 Meeting Street</i>: This is
the property of the South Carolina Society, built in 1804 as a
free school and meeting place, but the society dates to 1736
when it was formed by French Protestants for charitable purposes.
In the beginning it was known as the Two-Bit Club.
Through years it has done noble work in assisting the families
of deceased members and in educating their children. The
porch over Meeting Street is notably attractive; it was added
when the building was improved and enlarged. Members
have made liberal donations to this society, as mural tablets
in the hall attest. The St. Andrew&rsquo;s Society, organized by
Scots in 1729, is quartered in this building, accounting for
the presence of tables and chairs used in the Secession convention
in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Broad Street, burned in the fire
of 1861.</p>
<p class="tb">THE SWORD GATES, <i>32 Legare Street</i>: Years and years
ago, a famous school for girls was on this property under the
principalship of Madame Talvande, survivor of the Domingo
massacres. It is one of the most desirable residential properties
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
in Charleston. It was built in 1776. Through the Sword
Gates (1815-20), uncommonly fine examples of ornate and
graceful iron work, one peeps into a beckoning garden, protected
by high brick walls. The ballroom in the house is
known as one of the most elegant in Charleston. There are
really two houses, the older, of brick, on the north; the
wooden building has broad piazzas on two sides, overlooking
the large garden to the south and west. For years, after
the Confederate War, Colonel Charles H. Simonton, United
States Circuit Judge, distinguished Confederate officer, and
his family lived here. Now it is the property of a granddaughter
of President Abraham Lincoln, who owns also the
old Magwood Gardens in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Parish on the Ashley
River Road. Kinspeople of Mrs. Abraham Lincoln have long
been resident in the Barnwell section of this State.</p>
<p class="tb">BETH ELOHIM SYNAGOGUE, <i>74 Hasell Street</i>:
Charleston has had a Jewish congregation since 1750. The
tabernacle of Beth Elohim was dedicated in March, 1843, and
was among the first synagogues in which an organ was installed.
To this congregation is attributed the Jewish Reform
movement in the United States, which had its beginning in
1824. The Beth Elohim congregation had a tabernacle on
this site just after the Revolution; it was destroyed in the fire
of 1838. The incorporation of the congregation dates to 1781.
The present tabernacle is a fine example of the Athenian
style in architecture. Certain changes in the interior were
made about 1880.</p>
<p class="tb">YOUNG MEN&rsquo;S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, <i>26
George Street</i>: While this handsome and commodious building
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
was completed in 1912, the association in Charleston was
organized in 1854 and is one of the oldest. Its beginning was
less than ten years after the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association
was founded in London, England, June 6, 1844; the
Charleston date was February, 1854. The Charleston association
moved into its own building at 208 King Street in
1889 and there remained until it occupied the present building
at 26 George Street. Clarence Olney Getty has been general
secretary since 1917.</p>
<p class="tb">YOUNG WOMEN&rsquo;S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, <i>76
Society Street</i>: This Charleston branch of a great association
had its beginning in 1903. Its first quarters were in an old
residence at 21 George Street, the modern building coming
with the growth of membership and the increase of community
calls.</p>
<p class="tb">GRACE CHURCH, <i>100 Wentworth Street</i>: Its congregation
founded in 1840, its corner stone laid in July, 1847,
Grace Episcopal Church was consecrated November 9, 1848.
The Reverend Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, D.D., was its
rector from 1850 to his death in 1898, nearly a half century.
The Reverend William Way, D.D., has been rector more than
a quarter of a century. Grace has one of the largest and most
prosperous Episcopalian congregations in the South.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. PAUL&rsquo;S CHURCH, <i>126 Coming Street</i>: This is frequently
called St. Paul&rsquo;s, Radcliffeboro, as its site was outside
the town when the edifice was consecrated in March, 1816;
the congregation was founded in 1811. Its first rector was the
Reverend Dr. Percy, an Englishman, who in 1772 took charge
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
of the Bethesda school near Savannah, established by George
Whitefield. St. Paul&rsquo;s is a handsome building with Gothic
tower and an impressive portico, with four Doric columns.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. PETER&rsquo;S P.E. CHURCH, <i>Rutledge and Sumter Streets</i>:
On this site of Christ Church is St. Peter&rsquo;s, so named from the
old church at No. 8 Logan Street. Through arrangement of
the two vestries, the new St. Peter&rsquo;s came into the old St.
Peter&rsquo;s properties. The Logan Street church was burned in
the fire of 1861. Its graveyard is maintained. Possibly it was
on this site that Hessian soldiers were drilled during the
Revolution, as Charles Fraser says they went through their
military exercises in Logan Street.</p>
<p class="tb">CONVENT OF OUR LADY OF MERCY, <i>Legare and
Queen Streets</i>: This large brick building is of quite recent
construction, but the Sisters of Mercy have been in Charleston
more than a hundred years. Misses Mary Joseph and
Honora O&rsquo;Gorman, their niece, Mary Teresa Barry, fourteen
years and six months old, and Miss Mary Burke arrived in
Charleston November 23, 1829, coming on the invitation
of Bishop John M. England. The Misses O&rsquo;Gorman were
natives of Cork, living in Baltimore, Maryland. December 10
they accepted the habit of religion, with Sister Mary Joseph
as superioress of the new Community. In a small house on
Friend (now Legare) Street the Sisters established the Academy
of Our Lady of Mercy in December, 1830. Two years
later the Bishop established a seminary and appointed Sister
Mary Martha (Miss Honora O&rsquo;Gorman) to its supervision.
The Orphanage, Queen and Logan Streets, was established in
1840, under the care of the Sisters. The St. Francis Xavier
Infirmary, Ashley Avenue and Calhoun Street, dates to 1882;
it began in the McHugh residence, Magazine Street. In 1870
the Sisters acquired the old Nathaniel Russell house, 51 Meeting
Street, relinquishing it on the completion of the new Convent.
From the Charleston Community of Sisters of Mercy
have gone other communities into both Carolinas and Georgia.
Nor yellow fever nor war nor earthquake has swerved
these consecrated women. They were angels of mercy in the
yellow fever epidemics of 1835 and 1852. They nursed friend
and foe alike in the War for Southern Independence. Notwithstanding
the alarm and excitement in the time of the
earthquake (1886) they ministered calmly, sweetly, efficiently
to the sick and the injured.</p>

<p class="tb">BISHOP ENGLAND HIGH SCHOOL, <i>203 Calhoun
Street</i>: Long have the Catholics of Charleston had their
parochial schools and the Academy of Our Lady of Mercy
for girls. In 1914, in the pro-Cathedral, next to the Convent,
Bishop Northrop established the Bishop England High
School. Outgrowing these accommodations, it was transferred
to the former home of the Cenacle Nuns in Calhoun Street,
and on this site later the present large building was erected.
Under the principalship of the Reverend Joseph L. O&rsquo;Brien,
the school has acquired a shining progress.</p>
<p class="tb">BIRTHPLACE OF MASONRY, <i>Broad and Church
Streets</i>: Charleston has the oldest lodge of Ancient Free
Masons in this country. Chartered by the Grand Lodge in
England in 1735, Solomon&rsquo;s Lodge, No. 1, was organized in
October, 1736. Its communications were held above the old
Shepheard&rsquo;s Tavern, northeast corner of Broad and Church
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
Streets, now the home of the Citizens and Southern Bank,
successor to the Germania Savings Bank. The site is of interest
also in that here was instituted the mother council of the
Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Free Masonry in May,
1801, the significance of which is recognized by the Supreme
Council of the Scottish Rite, its headquarters in Washington.</p>
<p class="tb">THE IZARD HOUSES, <i>110-114 Broad Street</i>: Some time
before 1757 the Izard House in Charlestown was built. It
remained in the Izard family a hundred years and since then
has been in the possession of the family of Judge Mitchell
King. Next door to the west, Ralph Izard, in 1827, began the
erection of a house for his daughter, who sold it in 1829 to
her brother-in-law, Colonel Thomas Pinckney. It was later
acquired for the Bishop of Charleston. The Most Reverend
Emmet Walsh, sixth Bishop of Charleston, has residence
here. It is but three doors from the Cathedral of St. John the
Baptist.</p>
<p class="tb">JOHN RUTLEDGE&rsquo;S HOUSE, <i>116 Broad Street</i>: The
war in which the Cherokee Indians were humbled had not
been decided when this house was built in Charlestown. It
became the home of John Rutledge, known as the Dictator,
second Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States. President of the independent Republic of South Carolina
as the Revolution was breaking, he was clothed by the
Assembly in 1780-82 with dictatorial powers; he was then
Governor. The house, built in 1760, was the residence of
Robert Goodwyn Rhett, former Mayor of Charleston, former
president of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States,
chairman of the board of the People&rsquo;s State Bank of South
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Carolina. As guest of the Rhetts President William Howard
Taft was entertained in this house.</p>
<p class="tb">CYPRESS GARDENS, <i>On the Coastal Highway</i>: Twenty-three
miles north of Charleston, on the Coastal Highway
(United States No. 52) Benjamin R. Kittredge has developed
the Cypress Gardens. A cypress swamp, dark, mysterious,
witching, has been shaped into an attraction of great power.
To enjoy the Cypress Gardens to the full the visitor should
use a boat. In their seasons the azaleas on this property are
gorgeous, and in late spring the show of lotus is exquisite.
Mr. Kittredge more than twenty years ago acquired the Dean
Hall property, an old-time plantation on the Cooper River,
from James Petigru Carson, grandson of the eminent lawyer
and Unionist, James Louis Petigru.</p>
<p class="tb">CHARLESTON ORPHAN HOUSE, <i>160 Calhoun Street</i>:
When the City of Charleston was incorporated in 1783, it
was provided that poor orphan children should be cared for
by the town. At first boys and girls were boarded in private
homes and educated at Charleston&rsquo;s expense. In November,
1792, the corner stone of the orphanage on the present site
was laid, and in October, 1794, it was occupied. At that time
the roll of orphans numbered more than a hundred. In 1855,
the building was greatly improved and enlarged. In the belfry
is one of Charleston&rsquo;s fire-alarm bells and above the belfry
the figure of Charity. Clergymen of Charleston take turns in
officiating in the orphans&rsquo; chapel, on the Vanderhorst Street
side. Distinguished visitors to Charleston have inspected the
Orphan House, among them Grover Cleveland when he was
here, with Mrs. Cleveland, in 1888. The Charleston Orphan
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
House is one of the oldest in the country. Generous gifts and
legacies have greatly assisted the Board of Commissioners,
the chairman of whom at this time is the Honorable John F.
Ohlandt.</p>
<p class="tb">FIRST WHITE CHILD, <i>Born at East Bay and Tradd</i>:
The site of the Tradd home is at the northwest corner of East
Bay and Tradd Streets. Here was born the first white child of
the colony, a boy, Robert Tradd. The Tradd family has perished
in Charleston. It is perpetuated in the street so named.</p>
<p class="tb">JOHN EDWARDS&rsquo; HOUSE, <i>15 Meeting Street</i>: John
Edwards came from England and prospered as a merchant in
Charlestown. In 1770 he built the fine mansion at what is
now 15 Meeting Street. Edwards cast his lot with the patriots
and contributed of his fortune to the cause of independence.
&ldquo;I would rather lose my all, than retain it subject to British
authority,&rdquo; he is reported to have said. During the British
occupation in the Revolution, this house was quarters for
Admiral Arbuthnot (Sir Henry Clinton was in the Miles
Brewton house, 27 King Street). When in 1793 the French
fled from San Domingo, the illustrious Compte de Grasse was
entertained in this house. (Members of his family are interred
in old St. Mary&rsquo;s Churchyard, Charleston). The Edwards
home is the property of the family of George W. Williams,
banker.</p>
<p class="tb">GIBBES ART GALLERY, <i>131 Meeting Street</i>: &ldquo;For the
erection or purchase of a suitable building to be used as a hall
or halls for the exhibition of painting and for necessary rooms
for students in the fine arts,&rdquo; James S. Gibbes bequeathed
about $125,000. The memorial building was erected on the
site of the old Grand Opera House, opposite the site of the
South Carolina Institute Hall in which the <i>Ordinance of
Secession</i> was signed December 20, 1860. It is under supervision
of the Mayor and the Carolina Art Association,
chartered in December, 1858.</p>

Corbett&rsquo;s Tavern until construction of this hall. Dedicated
1841. Long a center of civic life in disasters as in prosperity.
Its presidents alternate Catholic and Protestant. Hibernian
Society.&rdquo; Prominent among its founders was Judge Aedanus
Burke, of whom many merry stories survive. Through many
years the St. Cecilia Society gave its balls in this hall. At the
St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day banquets of the Hibernian Society men of
lustrous national and international reputation have spoken.</p>
<p class="tb">THE ENSTON HOME, <i>720 King Street</i>: &ldquo;To make old
age comfortable,&rdquo; William Enston, native of Canterbury,
England, left his estate, after life tenures, for an institution
for old and infirm persons. In 1882, in the life-time of the
widow, arrangements for constructing the Enston Home were
begun and in February, 1899, the memorial hall, a chapel and
meeting place was formally dedicated. Cottages occupy about
a half of the property. The Board of Trustees is watchful of
the conditions warranting further growth. The Enston Home
is an exemplary practical charity.</p>
<p class="tb">BETHEL METHODIST CHURCH, <i>Calhoun and Pitt
Streets</i>: Elsewhere is reference made to the visits of John and
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
Charles Wesley to Charleston in 1736 and 1737. John Wesley
preached in St. Philip&rsquo;s Episcopal Church in 1737. It was in
1785 that Bishop Asbury and his associates came to Charleston.
Bethel, one of the strongholds of Methodism in South
Carolina, dates to 1850. The church building was dedicated
in 1853. It stands on the site where Wesley once preached
and the pulpit from which he preached is still in use. The
Sunday school building was erected in 1912. The earlier
Bethel, known as Old Bethel, moved from the site, is used by
a negro congregation at 222 Calhoun Street.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. LUKE&rsquo;S CHURCH, <i>20 Elizabeth Street</i>: For the convenience
of Episcopalians in the northeastern section of
Charleston, St. Luke&rsquo;s Church was founded in December,
1857. The corner stone of the present building was laid in
1859 and the church, though partly completed, used in February,
1862. During the War for Southern Independence Union
soldiers sacked the building and a negro female school was
held in it. In the fall of 1865 it was repossessed by the vestry.
In 1880 the congregation of St. Stephen&rsquo;s chapel, Anson
Street, united with St. Luke&rsquo;s. For a time after 1900 the church
was closed, but reopened by a section of the congregation of
St. Paul&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="tb">YEAMANS HALL, <i>Club on Goose Creek</i>: On property
taking its name from Sir John Yeamans, second Governor at
Charles Town, is the Yeamans Hall Club, an exclusive organization,
the members of which are mainly from the East.
A number of the members have their own cottages on the
property. Most of them are interested in hunting preserves in
coastal South Carolina. The club property is not open to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
public. It is on Goose Creek, some distance above its mouth.
The late Walter Camp, in a letter said: &ldquo;The combination of
golf and other sports, with fishing, hunting and the close
proximity of a large town for supplies renders the situation
particularly attractive.&rdquo; Golfers of wide experience have
pronounced the links at Yeamans Hall among the very best.
It is appropriate as Charleston boasted a golf club late in the
eighteenth century, on the Harleston Green.</p>
<p class="tb">UNITED STATES NAVY YARD, <i>on the Cooper River</i>:
The development of this naval base and station grew out of
a recommendation by a special board in 1901. Of particular
interest to the visitor is the old frigate <i>Hartford</i>, flagship of
Commodore Farragut in the Battle of Mobile Bay&mdash;&ldquo;Damn
the torpedoes; go ahead.&rdquo; For some years the cruiser <i>Olympia</i>,
flagship of Commodore Dewey in the Battle of Manila Bay,
was a receiving ship at the Charleston yard, but it was recommissioned
in the World War. The destroyer <i>Tillman</i>, the
gunboat <i>Asheville</i> and other naval craft have been built at
this yard, which is equipped with a dry dock large enough to
accommodate modern battleships, and with marine railways
of considerable capacity. One of the navy&rsquo;s most powerful
radio-telegraph stations is at the yard. Charleston&rsquo;s is the only
navy yard on the Atlantic Coast south of Norfolk, of peculiar
strategic value in relation to the Panama Canal. During the
World War thousands of bluejackets were trained here, and
the navy maintained a clothing factory with two thousand
operatives.</p>
<p class="tb">CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, <i>Broad and Church Streets</i>:
Having begun in 1773 the Charleston Chamber of Commerce
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
is the oldest in the United States. With the removal of the
Charleston Library to its building in King Street, the Chamber
of Commerce acquired the building, formerly the home of
the old South Carolina Bank.</p>
<p class="tb">THE COUNTRY CLUB, <i>on James Island</i>: On picturesque
property on James Island, on one side washed by Wappoo
Creek, the Charleston Country Club has a handsome and
comfortable house and an excellent golf course. The club
had its beginning in the Belvedere property on the Cooper
River, northward of Magnolia Cemetery. Charleston, according
to advertisements in the <i>Charleston City Gazette</i> in the
late 1790&rsquo;s, had the country&rsquo;s first golf club. The Country
Club is accessible by yacht as well as by motor, as it is on the
inland waterway. A mile from this club are the municipal
links, near the Stono River bridge, open to the public.</p>
<p class="tb">CHARLESTON&rsquo;S BANKS: Oldest banking house in the
South, dating to 1834, the main office of the South Carolina
National Bank is at the northeast corner of Broad and State
Streets. The old Bank of Charleston was the parent of the
banking system with offices in Columbia, Greenville, Sumter
and other South Carolina towns.</p>
<p>The Carolina Savings Bank&rsquo;s main offices are at the southwest
corner of Broad and East Bay Streets.</p>
<p>The Citizens and Southern Bank of South Carolina is in a
new home at the northeast corner of Broad and Church
Streets, site of the first Masonic lodge in this country.</p>
<p>The Miners and Merchants&rsquo; Bank is at 23 Broad Street.</p>
<p>Branch Offices of the banks are at convenient places in King
Street, the principal retail area.</p>

<p class="tb">THE FIRE OF 1861: This conflagration is given prominence
because of the great number of important buildings that
were destroyed. The Charleston City Year Book of 1880 says
that this fire began in a large sash and blind factory near the
foot of Hasell Street on the night of Wednesday, December
11, 1861. A gale blowing from the north-northeast the flames
swept through the town to the then west end of Tradd Street,
laying waste an area of 540 acres and inflicting property
damage of about seven millions of dollars. The fire was not
due to the war. Among the buildings burned were the Cumberland
Methodist Church, the Circular Church, the building
of the South Carolina Institute, the Charleston Theater, the
building of the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Society, the Catholic Cathedral
of St. Finbar and St. John, St. Peter&rsquo;s Episcopal Church, the
Quaker Meeting House.</p>
<p class="tb">CHARLESTON&rsquo;S BEACHES: Charleston is fortunate in
possession of resort beaches which are easily accessible. Sullivan&rsquo;s
Island, on which is old Fort Moultrie, has been a
popular summering place for many many years. Beyond it is
the Isle of Palms, with its nine-mile strand. A notable pavilion
has been a feature since 1899. Both of these islands are
reached by way of the Cooper River Bridge and the bridge
over Cove Inlet, between Mount Pleasant and Sullivan&rsquo;s
Island. The latter and the Isle of Palms are separated by
Breach Inlet, over which is a modern bridge. By way of the
Ashley River Bridge, thence through James Island, is the
route to Folly Beach, with its seven-mile strand. An entertainment
pier was built in time for the season of 1931; this is over
the water at high tide. To the east of Folly Beach is Morris
Island where stands the Charleston Light, the first and only
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
Colonial light south of the Delaware capes. To the west is
the desirable Island of Kiawah, property of the late Major
Arnoldus Vanderhorst.</p>
<p class="tb">PETIGRU&rsquo;S GRAVE, <i>in St. Michael&rsquo;s Yard</i>: When Woodrow
Wilson was attending the peace conference at Paris, a
message came to Charleston that the president wished the inscription
from the grave of James Louis Petigru in St.
Michael&rsquo;s Churchyard. It was furnished at once by Joseph M.
Poulnot, then postmaster at Charleston. Mr. Petigru was an
eminent South Carolinian. Notwithstanding that he opposed
Nullification and Secession he held the high opinion of the
community, and commanded its respect. Mr. Petigru, through
his mother, was a grandson of the French Protestant Pastor
Jean Louis Gibert, who led French settlers to the Abbeville
section in the late 1760&rsquo;s. The inscription on his tomb which
is widely quoted says in part:</p>
<p class="center">Future Times will hardly know
<br />How great a Life
<br />This simple stone commemorates;
<br />The tradition of his Eloquence,
<br />His Wisdom, and his Wit may fade:
<br />But he lived for Ends more durable than Fame.
<br />His learning illuminated the principles of Law:
<br />His Eloquence was the Protection of the Poor and Wronged.
<br />In the Admiration of his Peers:
<br />In the Respect of his People:
<br />In the Affection of his Family,
<br />His was the highest Place:
<br />The just Mead
<br />of his Kindness and Forbearance,
<br />His Dignity and his Simplicity,
<br />His brilliant Genius and his unwearied Industry.
<br />Unawed by Opinion,
<br />Unseduced by Flattery:
<br />Undismayed by Disaster,
<br />He confronted Life with antique Courage:
<br />And Death with Christian Hope:
<br />In the great Civil War
<br />He withstood his People for his Country:
<br />But his People did Homage to the Man
<br />Who held his Conscience higher than their Praise:
<br />And his Country
<br />Heaped her Honours upon the Grave of the Patriot,
<br />To whom, living,
<br />His own righteous self-Respect sufficed
<br />Alike for Motive and Reward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Mr. Petigru&rsquo;s funeral took place March 10, 1863. To a
Unionist who went with his people into Secession, highest
honors were paid even while the forces of the United States
were battering away at Charleston!</p>
<p class="tb">A HOUSE OF TRAGEDIES, <i>the Hanging of Lavinia
Fisher</i>: In 1820 lawlessness on the &ldquo;Neck&rdquo; northward of
Charleston was regnant. &ldquo;Gangs of white desperadoes occupied
certain houses and infested the roads leading to the
city. To such an extent did these outlaws carry their excesses
that wagoners and others coming to the City were under the
necessity of carrying rifles in their hands for their defense.
Travelers passed these houses with fear and trembling. More
dreaded than others of these haunts was that known as the
Six-Mile (?) house, occupied by John Fisher and Lavinia, his
wife,&rdquo; says King&rsquo;s <i>Newspaper Press of Charleston</i>. Fisher and
his wife were taken into custody and high crimes and misdemeanors
charged against them. In the cellar of their roadhouse
were found the bones of guests they had murdered.
Their motive was robbery. Their house was on the Meeting
Street Road, a section of the Old State Road, Charleston to
Columbia. The Fishers were tried and convicted in Charleston.
According to King they were hanged February 18, 1820,
&ldquo;at 2 o&rsquo;clock, just within the lines, on a hill east of the Meeting
Street Road, about eight hundred yards north of the street
known as Line Street continued.&rdquo; Mrs. Fisher was unnerved
and &ldquo;called upon the immense throng assembled to rescue her
and implored pity with outstretched and trembling hands.&rdquo;
King is mistaken about the Six-Mile house, as authorities say
that it was the Four-Mile house, the site of which is readily
located; it is four miles from the Charleston Court House on
the Meeting Street Road, about a mile north of Magnolia
Crossing, and visible from the King Street Extension which is
the Charleston approach by the Coastal Highway, United
States 52.</p>

<p class="tb">WESTMINSTER CHURCH, <i>Rutledge Avenue and Maverick
Street</i>: This Presbyterian congregation sold its building
at 273-75 Meeting Street to the Trinity Methodist Episcopal
congregation and erected a new church about two miles from
the other site. The congregation derives from St. Andrew&rsquo;s,
or the Third Presbyterian, Church in Archdale Street, built in
1814. It was due to a separation from the First (Scotch) Presbyterian
Church. The Reverend Dr. Buchan was the first
pastor. About 1850 this church was razed, the congregation
building anew on the west side of Meeting Street; the new
church was called the Central and for more than twenty years
was under the pastoral charge of the Reverend W. C. Dana.
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
With it merged the Glebe Street Presbyterian Church of
which the eminent Reverend Dr. J. L. Girardeau was pastor.
The Central Church became Westminster. The old yard in
Archdale Street is not now used for burials.</p>
<p class="tb">OLD THEATER SITE, <i>Joseph Jefferson, Manager</i>: In
1793 the Charleston Theater was built in a corner of Savage&rsquo;s
Green and about the same time New Street was built. Years
afterward Joseph Jefferson, famous and beloved American
comedian, managed a theater in Charleston. He told the
writer that it was at New and Broad Streets, but authorities
say that Mr. Jefferson was mistaken; that he meant another
old theater at Friend (Legare) and Broad Streets. The late
Reverend Dr. Robert Wilson told the writer that this was
another mistake, as Mr. Jefferson managed Placides Theater
in Queen Street! Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s mother was born in Charleston.</p>
<p class="tb">SUGAR FACTORY SITE, <i>Later a Home of Correction</i>:
According to <i>The Courier</i> (May 16, 1868) at the west end of
Broad Street was Savage&rsquo;s Green on which, before the Revolution
was built a manufactory for loaf sugar. For this reason
it was known as the Sugar House. It became a Work House
or House of Correction. &ldquo;The lot, together with the building,&rdquo;
says <i>The Courier</i>, &ldquo;was afterwards owned by Dr. Le Seignieur,
who, in 1807, contemplated the establishment of a cotton
manufactory. The plan was abandoned in consequence of the
machinery having been lost on its passage from Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">SECOND (FLINN&rsquo;S) CHURCH, <i>Meeting and Charlotte
Streets</i>: Presbyterians in Charleston growing in number
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
it was decided that another church was necessary and thus the
Second Church was organized in 1811. Its site is the highest
place within the City of Charleston, about fifteen feet above
mean low water. The tower behind the portico was intended
to be surmounted by a steeple, but this addition has yet to be
erected. From its first pastor, the church is often alluded to as
Flinn&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. MATTHEW&rsquo;S CHURCH, <i>403 King Street</i>: At Christmas,
1867, the corner stone for St. Matthew&rsquo;s German Evangelical
Lutheran Church was laid. The church building was
dedicated in March, 1872. The tallest spire in Charleston
surmounts the church. An impressive representation of the
Crucifixion is in a stained glass window.</p>
<p class="tb">CITADEL SQUARE CHURCH, <i>328 Meeting Street</i>: Offspring
of the old First Baptist Church in lower Church Street,
the Citadel Square was founded in 1854 and the building
dedicated in November, 1856. Members of the Wentworth
Street Baptist Church joined with the Citadel Square. In the
cyclone of 1885 the steeple fell in such manner as to carry
away the front walls of the residence at the northeast corner
of Meeting and Henrietta Streets. Several years ago the
church building was renovated, the already large auditorium
made larger. The Citadel Square, deriving its name from the
nickname of the Marion Square which it faces, has one of the
largest Baptist congregations in the South.</p>
<p class="tb">CHURCH OF THE HOLY COMMUNION, <i>Cannon
Street and Ashley Avenue</i>: From this church went its rector,
the Reverend H. J. Mikell to become Episcopal Bishop of
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
Atlanta. The late Anthony Toomer Porter, D.D., was its
rector for years and this gave the name of Holy Communion
Church Institute to what is now the Porter Military Academy.
St. Timothy&rsquo;s Chapel at Porter is more or less attached to the
Holy Communion.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. ANDREWS LUTHERAN, <i>37 Wentworth Street</i>:
This church building was severely damaged by Union shells
in the War for Southern Independence. It was then a Methodist
property. After Appomattox this congregation joined with
a Morris Street Lutheran congregation under the pastorate of
the Reverend Dr. W. S. Bowman. It has had a succession of
able, eloquent Lutheran ministers, including the Reverend
James A. B. Scherer and the Reverend M. G. G. Scherer.</p>
<p class="tb">ST. JOHANNES CHURCH, <i>48 Harrell Street</i>: This building
was first used by the St. Matthew&rsquo;s congregation which
later built on King Street opposite Marion Square. As St.
Johannes, it was organized in 1878, though the earlier
Lutheran congregation was there in 1841.</p>
<p class="tb">SHAW MEMORIAL SCHOOL, <i>22 Mary Street</i>: Charleston&rsquo;s
tolerance as a community may be illustrated in the Shaw
school for negroes. Since 1874 this institution has been in the
Charleston city school system. It is a memorial to Colonel
Robert G. Shaw, Union officer, who fell at the head of his
regiment of negro troops in the assault on Battery Wagner,
Morris Island, in the War for Southern Independence. His
family provided the &ldquo;spacious school house&rdquo; for negroes, the
land having been bought in 1868. The Shaw Monument Fund
was supported entirely from the North until 1874.</p>

<p class="tb">POINSETTIA PULCHERRIMA, <i>Named for Joel Roberts
Poinsett</i>: The Poinsettia is commonly known as Charleston&rsquo;s
flower. It was brought from Mexico by Joel Roberts Poinsett,
about 1828. &ldquo;There is some difference of opinion,&rdquo; says Dr.
Gabriel Manigault, &ldquo;as to whether Mr. Poinsett discovered it
himself or simply introduced it to this country.&rdquo; After his
retirement from a busy and distinguished public service, Mr.
Poinsett&rsquo;s home &ldquo;had always been in the City of Charleston.&rdquo;
His residence was &ldquo;situated upon what is now Rutledge
Avenue, on the east side, a few squares above Calhoun Street.
The house ... was recessed some distance from the street,
and stood in the midst of a grove of live oaks; it was generally
known as Poinsett&rsquo;s Grove.&rdquo; Mr. Poinsett was representative
in congress, minister to Mexico in an eventful period, Secretary
of War under President Van Buren, a rice planter who
contributed much to the improvement of the grain.</p>
<p class="tb">CHARLESTON&rsquo;S HOTELS: The Francis Marion, at King
and Calhoun Streets, in the heart of the retail shopping district,
facing Marion Square, was opened in the spring of 1924.
Its building was a community enterprise.</p>
<p>The Fort Sumter, facing the Battery, at the foot of King
Street, on the Ashley River, was opened in 1924. It maintains
a dock for yachts. It is in the exclusive residential section.</p>
<p>The St. John Hotel, built by Otis Mills, a caravansary with
a long and a distinguished record, is at the southwest corner
of Meeting and Queen Streets. President Theodore Roosevelt
stayed here in the winter of 1902.</p>
<p>The Timrod Hotel, opposite Washington Square, is a comfortable
and convenient place in the building formerly occupied
by the Commercial Club.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The Charleston Hotel, Meeting between Hayne and Pinckney,
has housed many notable guests, including the Princess
Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>The Argyle, northwest corner of Meeting and Hasell
Streets, was renovated and newly outfitted some years ago. It
was formerly the St. Charles.</p>
<p>Villa Margharita, South Battery and Church Street, was
the former home of Andrew Simonds, banker.</p>
<p class="tb">CABBAGE ROW, <i>Supposed Home of &ldquo;Porgy&rdquo;</i>: Everybody
coming to Charleston inquires about &ldquo;Porgy,&rdquo; the deformed
negro of whom DuBose Heyward wrote a best seller,
which was translated into a successful play. Cabbage Row, on
Church Street, near Tradd, west side, is the supposed Catfish
Row. Cabbage Row has been renovated and restored. &ldquo;Porgy&rdquo;
was a well-known Charleston character whose home was in
the former Village of Cool Blow, on upper Meeting Street.
His last days were tragedy. It would spoil a reading of
&ldquo;Porgy&rdquo; to discuss him at length.</p>
<p class="tb">WASHINGTON RACE COURSE, <i>August Belmont
Moved the Pillars</i>: Memories of the old Washington race
course survive, but the Jockey Club has been out of existence
these forty years. Decades have elapsed since races were
run on the course. The track was on property entered from
Rutledge Avenue near present-day Hampton Park. In 1901
the old pillars in the ornate gateway were purchased by
August Belmont and re&euml;rected at his Belmont Park, near
New York City. There are now no traces of the famous
race course to which in the season the South Carolina aristocracy
went in force and regalia. Notable races were run.</p>

<p>It is said that from the tops of
the highest buildings in Charleston
come under the eye more historic
places than come under it from any
other point in the United States.
The book tells the history of those
places. The Charles Town that
was and the Charleston this is are
brought before the reader. Names
of eminent Carolinians pass in
review and the greatness of the
lustrous past is linked with the
present.</p>
<p>In Charleston survive scars of
wars and storms and fires that
raged in the long ago. It has had
part in Indian, Spanish and French
wars. It has had bold adventure
with pirates. It was conspicuous
in the Revolution and in the War
for Southern Independence.</p>
<p>The fame of Middleton Place,
Magnolia, and Cypress gardens is
world-wide. Annually thousands
of people visit Charleston to walk
about these wonderful gardens that
are a living reminder of the beauty
wrought before the American
Revolution.</p>

South Carolina since Charleston
was a British outpost in a savage
land.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
